Hi! I go by Rylie on most platforms, _lumi9 on a few others, and I'm also under
many more aliases. I program random things in my free time, and I also code
professionally for a living.

My hobbies are anime, manga, playing games and programming, mainly a ton of
rhythm games, JRPGs and shooters. I am also proudly a Hoshimachi!

If you have job offers, or you're interested in requesting my work, contact me
anywhere and we'll work things out.

# programming

I write plenty of code as what can be described as a "Rust programmer." I also
dabble around in Python and TypeScript. My main hobbyist project right now is
[Miki Sayaka](https://github.com/j1nxie/mikisayaka), a Discord bot for sending
me manga updates as well as new gas prices updates.

Outside of that, I maintain maimai DX on
[Tachi](https://github.com/zkrising/Tachi) during my free time. I wrote the
original implementation, as well as the importer script to import scores from
the official web UI.

# rhythm games

I unfortunately play a *lot* of rhythm games, where you click, tap, or hit
things to music. I'd like to think I'm pretty decent at them too.
