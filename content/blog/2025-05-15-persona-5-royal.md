I cut my teeth on the Persona series with Persona 4 Golden, having sampled 2 episodes of the anime with friends. I never ended up playing too much of it, only about a couple of hours in. P4G really felt dated even without playing P5R for comparison, but that's for another time.

I left it to the side for quite a bit of time, not wanting to play it on Xbox Game Pass. And then, Steam's Family Sharing expansion happened, and a friend of mine had the game in his library... And thus, 120 hours of my life was spent away in 201X Tokyo.
