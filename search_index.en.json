December has started, and once again, another\nAdvent of Code starts! For this year, I’ll attempt\nto solve the puzzles on the days they are released, with solutions written\nmainly in Rust. For some puzzles, I shall try to up the ante by writing a\nsolution in Game Boy-flavored C.\n\nSetting up my setup environment\nI will be generating my code repository using\nfspoettel’s\nadvent-of-code-rust. This is\na very neat repository template that has all the features you will need for\nAdvent of Code: day scaffolding, built-in unit tests, input downloading, etc. It\nis very easy to setup and helps you with organizing your AoC codebase.\nAfter generating my repository from the template, my personal preferences are to\nenable Clippy and the automated README.md progress tracker. Then, I will clone\nthe repository, and cargo scaffold 01 to prepare the files for the first day.\nWith all that set up, time to proceed with the actual solving!\n\nSolving the first part\nI will be quoting each day’s question statement, minus the flavor text. The\nfirst part is given as below:\n\nThe jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or\naccess from the air; the Elves’ expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your\nboats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One\nimportant consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories\neach Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).\nThe Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the\nvarious meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they’ve brought with them, one item\nper line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf’s\ninventory (if any) by a blank line.\nFor example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items’ Calories and end up\nwith the following list:\n\nThis list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:\nThe first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a\ntotal of 6000 Calories.\nThe second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.\nThe third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of\n11000 Calories.\nThe fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a\ntotal of 24000 Calories.\nThe fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.\nIn case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which\nElf to ask: they’d like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf\ncarrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by\nthe fourth Elf). Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total\nCalories is that Elf carrying?\n\nThis question is a rather simple one. As each chunk, seperated by an empty line,\nrepresents a single Elf, I will split the input text into each chunk, and push\neach chunk into a Vec. An empty Vec will also be created to hold the\nCalories count of each Elf (this will be empty because we will take care of this\npart later!)\n\nAfterwards, I will iterate through each Elf inside the elves vector, parse\neach of the &amp;str line to obtain its value, and sum all those values up to get\nthe total Calories count of an Elf. I will then push this value into the foods\nvector created above.\n\nAfter dealing with this, it’s just a matter of using a few Rust methods, namely\n.into_iter() and .max() to obtain the maximum amount of Calories carried.\n\nThe Some and the u32 cast was used here as the return type of the functions\nas scaffolded by advent-of-code-rust is Option&lt;u32&gt; by default.\nI will be editing the test case result in the test_part_one() function into\n24000 as given in the question statement as well.\n\n\nSolving the second part\nThe second part’s question statement is given as such:\n\nBy the time you calculate the answer to the Elves’ question, they’ve already\nrealized that the Elf carrying the most Calories of food might eventually\nrun out of snacks.\nTo avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would instead like to know the\ntotal Calories carried by the top three Elves carrying the most Calories.\nThat way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they still have two\nbackups.\nIn the example above, the top three Elves are the fourth Elf (with 24000\nCalories), then the third Elf (with 11000 Calories), then the fifth Elf\n(with 10000 Calories). The sum of the Calories carried by these three elves\nis 45000.\nFind the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. How many Calories are\nthose Elves carrying in total?\n\nWe will be going through the same steps as the previous part: Splitting text\ninput into chunks, pushing them into a vector, calculating the total Calories\ncount for each Elf.\n\nFor the next step, I’ll be using Rust’s built-in .sort_by() method to sort the\nfoods vector in descending order.\n\nAfter that, it’s just a matter of grabbing the sum of the first 3 elements of\nthe above vector.\n\nSimilar to the previous part’s test case, I’ll be editing its result to 45000\nas given by the question statement.\n\n\nAfterword\nAs typical for all day 1 questions of each year, this is a rather simple and\nstraightforward question that can basically be solved using some parsing. The\nharder part of this is to write clean and Rust-y code I guess? I feel like I can\ndefinitely make the for loops more Rust-y by using iterator methods more, but\nI still haven’t figured it out yet!\nMy code can be found on my\nGitHub.

The second column–” Suddenly, the Elf is called away to\nhelp with someone’s tent.\nThe second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: X for\nRock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors. Winning every time would be suspicious,\nso the responses must have been carefully chosen.\nThe winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your\ntotal score is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a\nsingle round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for\nPaper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0\nif you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).\nSince you can’t be sure if the Elf is trying to help you or trick you, you\nshould calculate the score you would get if you were to follow the strategy\nguide.\nFor example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:\n\nThis strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:\n\nIn the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should\nchoose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2\nbecause you chose Paper + 6 because you won).\nIn the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should\nchoose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 +\n0).\nThe third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you\na score of 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nIn this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a\ntotal score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).\nWhat would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your\nstrategy guide?\n\nOnce again, I feel like this is another parsing question. My main idea is to go\nthrough each line, splitting the line into two parts: the opponent’s move, and\nour response to it, and do things with these two parts.\nFirst things first, I’ll be editing the test case to return the value of 15.\n\nLooking at the question statement, we have Rock, Paper and Scissors having 1, 2\nand 3, respectively, as their score. So, similarly, I will be parsing both\nopponent and response to their numeric values, and assigning it to a tuple\n(left, right).\n\nBecause we get a score according to our response’s numeric values, I’ll add\nwhat we choose immediately to the score counter. I’ll be editing the match\narms for response to the one below:\n\nThe unreachable!() macro is for matching against all other theoretically\npossible values of opponent and response, which are both of the &amp;str type.\nThis shouldn’t be possible with our inputs, but since Rust is rather pedantic\nabout careful checks, this is what we will have to do.\nLet’s take care of the case where we draw first, since it’s the simpler one. If\nwe convert both opponent and response to their numeric values (assigned to\nleft and right respectively, as above), it’s clear that right - left == 0.\nAfter that, our score will increase by 3, as stated by the question. We will\nhave our first check:\n\nFor the case where we win, it’s a bit more complicated. Again, Rock, Paper and\nScissors have the values of 1, 2 and 3 respectively. For example, if the\nopponent used Rock, and we were Paper, we would have right - left == 1. It\nwould be the same with the opponent using Paper and us using Scissors. But, what\nabout the case of us using Rock, and the opponent used Scissors? right - left\nwould equate to -2, and this is the edge case that we would have to check for\nas well. Our score will increase by 6 in that case. So, at the end, our code\nto check for the winning case would be:\n\nWe will be returning the value of score for the function:\n\nAnd that’s basically the first part finished! We don’t have to do anything in\nthe case we lost, since our score doesn’t increase from it, according to the\nquestion statement.\n\nSolving the second part\n\nThe Elf finishes helping with the tent and sneaks back over to you. “Anyway,\nthe second column says how the round needs to end: X means you need to lose,\nY means you need to end the round in a draw, and Z means you need to win.\nGood luck!”\nThe total score is still calculated in the same way, but now you need to\nfigure out what shape to choose so the round ends as indicated. The example\nabove now goes like this:\n\nIn the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you need the\nround to end in a draw (Y), so you also choose Rock. This gives you a\nscore of 1 + 3 = 4.\nIn the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you choose\nRock so you lose (X) with a score of 1 + 0 = 1.\nIn the third round, you will defeat your opponent’s Scissors with Rock for\na score of 1 + 6 = 7.\n\nNow that you’re correctly decrypting the ultra top secret strategy guide, you\nwould get a total score of 12.\nFollowing the Elf’s instructions for the second column, what would your\ntotal score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?\n\nThis is where it gets a little bit more complicated. I can’t just parse the\nvalues as is anymore, because we only have what the opponent chose and the\nresult of the match-up instead. I’ll solve this using the same method I used\nto solve a previous AoC question. I’ll create an enumerator with values for\nwinning, losing and drawing to some value, like such below:\n\nI will have a .matches() method implemented for this enumerator, which gives\nus a value that will win, lose or draw against the value stored in the\nenumerator. For example, MatchVal::Win(1) will return us 2, as Paper (2)\nwins against Rock (1). I will have to guard this against overflow and\nunderflow, similar to the above case when Paper and Scissors were chosen.\n\nAnd that’s basically it! The only thing left is to write the function body for\nthe actual second part of the program:\n\nOnce again, I’ll be going through each line, splitting it into opponent and\nresponse, then parsing these two parts. left will once again be the\nopponent’s move, in numbers, and right will be our response according to the\nstrategy guide. I’ll be adding the scores right when we assign the value to\nright for convenience’s sake, then it’s just adding the value of our response\ninto the score.\n\nAfterword\nThis is a pretty tough one to implement, if I had to be honest. I cycled through\na few ideas, including just brute-forcing through all the cases, but the idea\nfrom that 2015 AoC problem helped me get through it. I also made a really dumb\nmistake of assigning X as winning and Z as losing and it took me so long to\nrealize T_T.\nMy code, once again, can be found on my\nGitHub.\n","description":"","id":"https://rylie.moe/blog/aoc-2022-day-02/","path":"/blog/aoc-2022-day-02/","title":"Advent of Code 2022, Day 02 in Rust"},"https://rylie.moe/blog/aoc-2022-day-03/":{"body":"Getting to the third day, things are a slight bit more complicated this time.\n\nSolving the first part\n\nEach rucksack has two large compartments. All items of a given type are\nmeant to go into exactly one of the two compartments. The Elf that did the\npacking failed to follow this rule for exactly one item type per rucksack.\nThe Elves have made a list of all of the items currently in each rucksack\n(your puzzle input), but they need your help finding the errors. Every item\ntype is identified by a single lowercase or uppercase letter (that is, a and\nA refer to different types of items).\nThe list of items for each rucksack is given as characters all on a single\nline. A given rucksack always has the same number of items in each of its two\ncompartments, so the first half of the characters represent items in the first\ncompartment, while the second half of the characters represent items in the\nsecond compartment.\nFor example, suppose you have the following list of contents from six\nrucksacks:\n\n\nThe first rucksack contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp, which\nmeans its first compartment contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWr, while the\nsecond compartment contains the items hcsFMMfFFhFp. The only item type\nthat appears in both compartments is lowercase p.\nThe second rucksack’s compartments contain jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGL and\nrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL. The only item type that appears in both compartments\nis uppercase L.\nThe third rucksack’s compartments contain PmmdzqPrV and vPwwTWBwg; the\nonly common item type is uppercase P.\nThe fourth rucksack’s compartments only share item type v.\nThe fifth rucksack’s compartments only share item type t.\nThe sixth rucksack’s compartments only share item type s.\n\nTo help prioritize item rearrangement, every item type can be converted to a\npriority:\n\nLowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26.\nUppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52.\n\nIn the above example, the priority of the item type that appears in both\ncompartments of each rucksack is 16 (p), 38 (L), 42 (P), 22 (v), 20\n(t), and 19 (s); the sum of these is 157.\nFind the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack. What\nis the sum of the priorities of those item types?\n\nThe first part isn’t too much outside of some parsing each line of the text\ncontent. Let’s get to work, shall we?\nThe above example gave us a result of 157, so let’s start with modifying the\ntest result to 157.\n\nSince we are finding the single letter that is shared between two strings, my\nidea is to convert them into HashSets, then finding the intersection between\nthose two sets (basic set theory is powerful here!). Afterwards, I’ll simply be\nconverting the found character to its priority, then summing them up. I think\nthe code below is rather self explanatory.\n\nI splitted the input line into half (at the position length / 2), then\ninserting each character of those two halves into two different HashSets.\nThen, I used the .intersection() method onto the two, and processed that.\nWhy - 96 and - 64 + 26? The characters a to z has the ASCII values of\n97 to 122, so to convert them back into the priority numbers the question\nwanted, I subtracted them by 96 to get the priority. Similarly, the ASCII values\nof A to Z are 65 to 90, so I’ll subtract them by 64, and then adding 26\nto make them match the priorities given by the question.\n\nSolving the second part\n\nFor safety, the Elves are divided into groups of three. Every Elf carries a\nbadge that identifies their group. For efficiency, within each group of three\nElves, the badge is the only item type carried by all three Elves. That\nis, if a group’s badge is item type B, then all three Elves will have item\ntype B somewhere in their rucksack, and at most two of the Elves will be\ncarrying any other item type.\nThe problem is that someone forgot to put this year’s updated authenticity\nsticker on the badges. All of the badges need to be pulled out of the\nrucksacks so the new authenticity stickers can be attached.\nAdditionally, nobody wrote down which item type corresponds to each group’s\nbadges. The only way to tell which item type is the right one is by finding\nthe one item type that is common between all three Elves in each group.\nEvery set of three lines in your list corresponds to a single group, but each\ngroup can have a different badge item type. So, in the above example, the\nfirst group’s rucksacks are the first three lines:\n\nAnd the second group’s rucksacks are the next three lines:\n\nIn the first group, the only item type that appears in all three rucksacks is\nlowercase r; this must be their badges. In the second group, their badge\nitem type must be Z.\nPriorities for these items must still be found to organize the sticker\nattachment efforts: here, they are 18 (r) for the first group and 52 (Z)\nfor the second group. The sum of these is 70.\nFind the item type that corresponds to the badges of each three-Elf group.\nWhat is the sum of the priorities of those item types?\n\nWell, this isn’t much more than the first question, but to consider every 3\nlines as a group, instead of two halves of one line.\nLet’s edit our test case to 70 first:\n\nBecause this part of the question isn’t much more than parsing every 3 lines, I\nopted for a bunch of Rust iterator magic. I think explaining each line as\ncomments would be easier, so below would be my code, with comments!\n\n\nAfterword\nOnce again, a parsing problem that takes more effort to think about the parsing\nmethod than actually solving the problem! Not too hard, just really annoying to\nthink about how to code in an idiomatic way.\nMy code can be found on my\nGitHub.\n","description":"","id":"https://rylie.moe/blog/aoc-2022-day-03/","path":"/blog/aoc-2022-day-03/","title":"Advent of Code 2022, Day 03 in Rust"},"https://rylie.moe/blog/bad-game-design-persona-5-royal/":{"body":"\nThis post contains spoilers for Persona 5 Royal! If you haven’t played the\ngame yet, I suggest you stop reading to avoid spoilers, else, proceed at your\nown caution.\n\nRecently, I decided to pick up Persona 5 Royal, as I broke my controller and…\nPersona 4 Golden on a keyboard felt horrible (this probably needs its own blog\npost…) so I put it on pause for now. Fast-forward a few weeks later and I’m 60\nhours into it. I’ve been enjoying the game a whole lot, but there are points\nwhere I feel like the game is out to annoy me. I’ve still got half the game left\nto go - but these will be my thoughts up to this point, for Kaneshiro’s bank and\nOkumura’s spaceport.\n\nKaneshiro’s Palace\nThe third palace in the game. This is probably the first instance that I felt\nlike the game was a bit annoying. The palace itself is fine thematically, and\nthe OST was really nice too. But, despite all that, the mechanics in this palace\nfelt so wrong.\nThe main puzzle within the palace involves the security system, where you have\nto decode a 4-letter word into numbers to progress. Each letter corresponds to a\nnumber, and you have to go around the palace collecting torn pages from\nKaneshiro’s journal to form the cipher.\nThe page-collection part itself is fine, running around the palace to find the\npages is pretty simple. Each page is in a very visible piggy-bank-shaped\ncontainer. I was stuck for like… 20 minutes finding myself missing a page, but\nthat was mostly my fault for overlooking a container right next to a room\nentrance.\nOne of the annoying part about this is how the hints are basic arithmetics, but\nthere are so many of them you are basically required to have a notepad of some\nsort to solve for all the letters involved. But, alas, it’s fine, I’ll let this\none slide.\nThe worst part about this palace has to be how you have to do this a total of\nthree times. And for every corridor you clear while finding each keypad,\nthere are no safe rooms - there’s only one at the start of the vault. If you end\nup failing a single encounter randomly (god bless this game’s RNG!), that means\nyou’re restarting from the start of that corridor.\nOf course, I can see how this is just the game being “difficult” and punishing\nfailure, but it’s just slightly annoying how you have to reclear each vault\nfloor if you accidentally fail a fight. The fights aren’t hard, but it’s very\neasy to randomly die if you get a stupid effect proc.\nNonetheless, I feel like the mechanics of Kaneshiro’s Palace are just slightly\nannoying, in the lines of being tedious, but it’s not totally bad. It’s a nice\nend to Makoto’s story arc, and I didn’t lose too much time pulling my hair to\nfinish it.\n\nOkumura’s Palace\nKaneshiro’s Palace is definitely, definitely, definitely no match for this.\nThe fifth palace in the game has to be one of the worst designed palaces I’ve\never seen. It’s so bad we even got subsections for it!\n\nTimed mechanics\nA ton of the mechanics are timed, which technically fits the theme of\n“capitalism draining everyone dry”, but it’s just so, so, so annoying. Pathing\nthrough the map involves a bunch of 30-second timed platforms, and you need to\nbacktrack and re-activate the platforms to progress if you don’t make it in\ntime. This time passes during fights too, so if you accidentally get an\nencounter, have fun backtracking!\nYippee, you’ve made it to the end of the palace, and you sent the calling card.\nYou enter the palace again, fast travel to the last section before the boss\nencounter, and you feel like you’re so prepared to do this boss fight. You’re\nwrong. You are not ready to do this boss fight.\nAfter a little bit of a cutscene, a 10-minute timer starts, and you’re supposed\nto chase after Okumura. You are supposed to run through a Shadow-infested\ncorridor to catch up to him, and you have to do this in 10 minutes. If you don’t\nmake it in time, you have to restart from the start of the corridor. This is the\nmost annoying part of the palace, and it’s just so, so, so frustrating.\nThankfully, the kind developers at Atlus has added the grappling hook to Royal,\nand you have a shortcut to skip yourself straight to the boss encounter,\nrendering the annoyance of this 10-minute timer to essentially null.\nThat should be it right? Oh dear sweet summer child, you’re getting even more\nwrong. The boss fight has a thirty-minute time limit. “It’s a whopping\nthirty minutes!”, I hear you say. Well, let me tell you about the mechanics.\n\nBoss fight mechanics\nOkumura sends waves of four robots of increasing strength to face you, while\nhe sits in the back and either buffs them or debuffs your party. The robots are\nweak to certain elements, and resists everything else. You have met all of these\nrobots as part of the introductory sequence of the palace, and good luck\npreparing for all of them.\nFor you, you have three turns to attack and kill these robots to clear the\n“wave”. If you don’t kill them in time, if you dealt even just a single\npoint of damage to any of them, they would flee and you would fail the wave.\nThis is probably the part where the game expects you to abuse the hell out of\nBaton Passes to maximize damage dealt, but I’m telling you, even on Normal\ndifficulty, maximum Baton Passes on Haru struggles to take down the last wave of\nrobots.\nThis straight up makes it extremely annoying as these robots are super tanky\nand they deal a ton of damage to your party as well. With all of this, you can\nprobably start to see how thirty minutes straight up isn’t enough to clear the\nfight.\nI’ve sat and pulled my hair for at least three hours doing Okumura’s boss\nfight and I still haven’t cleared it, and I’ve got close to clearing the fight\nonly once… If this isn’t one of the worst designed boss fights in the game,\nI don’t know what is. It frustrates me genuinely because Haru’s arc was getting\nreally, really good and this horrible boss fight makes it so tedious to go\nthrough, and simply ruins the narration for me purely because how long it takes\nto finish it. I’ve also spent at least two hours looking at Reddit posts asking\non how to fight it and a whole lot of them is pointing towards abusing\nMerciless’ 3x weakness multiplier and a DLC Persona to clear the fight. I’m\nvery close to just doing that, but I’m still holding out hope that I can clear\nit without resorting to that. The sheer difficulty of the fight just makes me\nreconsider doing NG+ runs as well, but I will see how that goes…\n\nThe damn airlock puzzles\nA bit before the boss fight, you have to go through a series of airlock puzzles\nto progress. It’s not very clear what you really need to do, other than\ntoggling the various switches to progress. It’s so annoying that you constantly\nneed to constantly toggle the map to find out the path you need to take while\nattempting to grab the third Will Seed. The pathing took me forever since you’re\nmeant to go in one specific direction. This puts the icing on the cake for how\nbad Okumura’s Palace is designed. Thank god you’re not timed on this\nsection, or else I would genuinely flip doing this palace.\n\nClosing thoughts\nWhile I’ve learnt to accept Kaneshiro’s bank, Okumura’s spaceport is still\nsomething I genuinely am frustrated about. This really ruined the experience for\nthis part of the game for me, and it made me feel stuck similar to Yakuza Kiwami\n2’s Man in Black fight. But alas, after writing this, I’ll probably spend the\nnext few hours trying to clear this fight, but this will definitely go down as\none of the worst designed fights I’ve ever witnessed in a JRPG.\nI still want to make clear that this doesn’t make Persona 5 (Royal) a bad game\nby any means! It’s still a truly enjoyable experience overall, and I still don’t\nregret the hours I’ve sunken into this game. I really recommend it if you are\ninterested in turn-based RPGs, or you wanted a good entry point into the Persona\nseries.\n","description":"","id":"https://rylie.moe/blog/bad-game-design-persona-5-royal/","path":"/blog/bad-game-design-persona-5-royal/","title":"Bad Game Design: Kaneshiro and Okumura's Palaces in Persona 5 Royal"},"https://rylie.moe/blog/csctf-2024-notes/":{"body":"These are less writeups, more informal notes for myself to remind myself how I\nsolved certain things in CTFs.

It’s a lot of work for\nmoderators to actually scan through and spot these images, and it looks like a\nvery automatable thing because we have a list of disallowed artists, thus,\nJane Doe was born! It uses dhash1 to compare posted images with a database\nof known images, scraped off of imageboards.\nI’ll talk more about Jane Doe in another blog post in the near future (maybe)\n(if I ever get around to writing one) (I swear), what we’re going to look at\ntoday is how I built the infrastructure to deploy it to my servers securely.\n\nIntroducing Kamal\nKamal is a neat little tool that wraps around\nDocker and SSH to quickly deploy web apps to various servers from your own\nmachine. By default, running kamal deploy in a Kamal-initialized repository\nwill trigger a build using the Dockerfile within the repository, then it will\nproceed to deploy said build to servers that you’ve defined within the config file.\nKamal also comes with the ability to define “accessories”. These are\nlong-running services that are required by your app, such as databases,\nsimilar to things you would define in your Docker Compose file. Running\nkamal accessory boot will spin up new accessory services on the defined hosts.\n\nIntroducing Tailscale\nTailscale is a VPN service that allows connecting your\ndevices securely under networks called “tailnets”. This is what I will use to\nconnect to my machines without the need to expose their IPs and port 22 to the\npublic Internet.\n\nIntroducing GitHub Actions\n…really now, you wouldn’t need this to be introduced, would you?\nFiiiiiiiine, I’ll tell you about it anyways. GitHub Actions\nis GitHub’s own CI/CD2 platform, for automating software development\nworkflows. You can define triggers to automatically run test suites, Docker\nbuilds, so on. We’ll use this to automatically build our Discord bot and deploy\na build through Kamal.\nAnyways, with our major players introduced out of the way, let’s get started\nwith how this works.\n\nInitializing and configuring Kamal\nWe’ll start with initializing Kamal within the repository. You’ll need\nconfig/kamal.yml, which can be quickly created using kamal init. Mine is\nbelow, nicely annotated:\n\nThe ERB template strings are there to directly pull environment variables\ndefined within the GitHub Action workflow, similar to how you could access\ncontext variables in the workflow YAML files.\nAlongside it, we also need a .kamal/secrets file to load\nsecrets\ninto the container during deployment:\n\n\nSetting up the workflow itself alongside Tailscale\n\nWoah, that’s one hella long workflow file. My build job is nothing too\ncomplicated, just the usual docker/build-push-action setup to get an image up\ninto GHCR. The main interesting part is in the deploy job, let’s see how it works.\nWell, I sort of lied, the first half of installing Ruby into the environment,\nsetting up Kamal, setting up Tailscale using the\nofficial guide,\nnothing too interesting.\nI use webfactory/ssh-agent\nto insert a SSH private key into the GitHub Action worker node, as my server\nhas password authentication disabled.\n\nThis setup doesn’t work right out of the box, you’ll need to do a bit of\nbootstrapping! Create a new SSH keypair on your server and add it to the root\nuser’s authorized keys:\n\nThis will make sure that Kamal is able to SSH into the server and deploy the\nDiscord bot!\nWhy root? Uh… I run fish on my servers and they\naren’t compatible with the commands that Kamal runs to deploy the services…\nPlease create a user for deployment on your server and add the public key to\nthat user’s authorized_keys file instead. Do as I say, not as I do.\n\nThen, at the final step, we’ll pull in all the environment variables to load\ninto Kamal as secrets, and run Kamal with the --skip-push argument, as we’ve\nalready built the image during the previous step and cached it.\nThe VERSION environment is very important also, as the workflow will push the\nimage on the main tag, whereas Kamal by default pushes and expects a version\ntag as the Git commit hash!\n\nOf course, remember to actually add in the secrets to your GitHub repository!\nI used the gh CLI utility to add them to my repository, through the command:\n\n\nWith this setup, you’ll need to add a service label to the resulting Docker\nimage, as Kamal expects this label to know which container to spin down during\ndeployment of new versions. This label should be the same as the service key\nwithin Kamal’s configuration file.\n\n\nConclusion\nWith this, we’ve completed a whole CI/CD workflow that does all the annoying\nparts of running a project: actually deploying it. Say goodbye to the annoying\ndays of manually SSHing into a server, pulling new code, restarting the Compose\nstack, or in my case, logging into a Portainer instance that’s behind a\nTailscale tailnet that I cannot access conveniently at work to deploy my projects.\nOf course, there’s still plenty I could improve to fine-tune the deployment\nexperience, but for now, I think this is one hell of a good job for like, 4\nhours of figuring out off of documentations!\n\n\n\nA differential gradient hash that compares the difference in gradient\nbetween adjacent pixels, and provides a 64-bit signature of an image. ↩\n\n\nContinuous integration and continuous delivery. ↩\n\n\n\n","description":"Writing a Discord bot sure comes with its own inconveniences: actually deploying it and keeping it running.

Unironically. I’m as much as a music enjoyer as I am an anime\nenjoyer, so idol shows really strike this spot for me. During my venture on\nosu! and the likes, seeing Macross Delta’s\nmusic has very much piqued my interest in the series, just by how many bangers\nthere are, but I put off watching it for suuuuuuuch a long time. Fast forward a\nfew years, I pulled it to my media server’s hard drive, and seeing that we\nneeded to free up some space, I decided to go and watch it to see how the show\ntruly is outside of the songs. And I didn’t expect myself to be pulled in So.\nDamn. Hard.\n\nTL;DR, and if you wanted to avoid spoilers: 7.5/10, watch it if you have a\nsoft spot for idol-esque shows like me, you wanna listen to absolute bangers\nbeing inserted within a show, or you’re interested in the Macross franchise as\na whole.\nPotential wasted on a few characters, but overall well developed. Art was\namazing for a 2016 production, maybe even better than currently airing shows.\nMusic is absolutely amazing, I cannot recommend their songs enough.\n\nSpoilers warning! You have been warned.\nLet’s start with the characters! I like Freyja. She is probably the most likable\nidol-anime-main-character to date for me, and I’m not usually one to really\njust go for the main girl in an idol anime. Her character development within the\nshow is amazing, especially with the situations that she’s being put in, being a\nWindermerean, choosing to side with the Earthlings and Walküre during a war\nagainst Windermere.\nKaname is probably one of my favorite characters to see as well. She’s a very\nstrong person, being motivated instead of being depressed from Mikumo’s\nappearance replacing her role as the center of Walküre. Hers and Messer’s joint\narc really developed their characters well in my opinion, but at the same time I\nwished Messer’s character and relationships were explored more within the show.\nMirage was the woman I rooted for within the Hayate - Freyja - Mirage love\ntriangle, but as track records showed, every woman I root for lost their romance\narcs &lt;/3 It’s cute to see Freyja and Hayate’s relationship develop, but at the\nsame time it felt like Mirage barely touched the surface of her feelings towards\nHayate. I’m so heartbroken my tall redhead elf woman lost…\nThe rest of the characters felt like… recurring background characters that you\nsee here and there, funnily enough. It doesn’t feel like they play a large\nenough role during the story and you barely remember the names and faces of\nthem. It feels like a lot of wasted potential, especially during Messer’s (and\nlater on Hayate’s) duels against Keith, where they often made it just 1-on-1\nfights and very heavily focused on them. Even the two Walküre members, Makina\nand Reina, felt like they were just there to be the harmony for Freyja and\nMikumo during songs.\nIn terms of story, I’m unsure how much they have Zettai\nLive!!!!! in mind while writing the original\nscript for the TV show, but how it ended felt really… incomplete. The literal\nconflict that was happening within the show didn’t get resolved towards the\nend, and it gives you this feeling of being left hanging.\nThe music is definitely where Macross Delta shines the most. The insert songs\nare bangers by themselves, and how they incorporated them into the show is\ninsane too. You often see idol-esque shows just having the audio recorded and\nplayed during the episodes, but certain situations really made it feel like the\nWalküre members are truly live on stage. Their vocals are re-recorded to make\nyou really hear the situation they’re in, like how they mixed in Makina’s weak\nsinging voice trying to harmonize with her group after taking a sniper shot to\nprotect Freyja, or their voices straining as they are trying to move around\nwhile being attacked by the Aerial Knights.\nHonestly, Macross Delta’s art stands very well against a lot of anime, in my\nopinion. They don’t often have weird frames where the characters are insanely\nlowres, the fights are choreographed really nicely, the characters are very well\ndone too.\nGenerally, it was a very enjoyable experience. I was pretty hooked in for the 26\nepisodes and I am one to have a short attention span. So there’s that, now\nGO WATCH IT!\n","description":"","id":"https://rylie.moe/blog/macross-delta/","path":"/blog/macross-delta/","title":"Macross Delta (2016)"},"https://rylie.moe/blog/no-code-sundays/":{"body":"I used to be a really rough person when it comes to my own productivity - I\noften forced myself to do “at least 30 minutes of productivity per day”, but as\nalways, it often falls short and I will end up not really doing anything.\nSimilarly, if I simply let myself “do whatever I wish to”, I would also end up\nnot doing anything because most of my time is spent playing video games and\nwatching anime.\nFast forward to recently, I’ve just kinda been… working during the week, and\nleaving Sundays for cleaning, resting and just enjoying myself.\n\n(Excuse that one Sunday, I was fixing my own website on my free time.)\nI really worked myself out that July and honestly, I can feel that month being\nmy downfall. A lot happened during that month, I can really feel myself\nbeing unhappy, nothing felt right. Of course, granted that August was when I\nstarted therapy as well, and it really helped my mental state.\nOf course, as a programmer, your productivity isn’t just shown by churning\nout commits and code, but at the same time, I do feel like commits and code are\nthe consolidation of your research and thought process. And oftentimes, while\noverworking myself with not taking a proper break, I wouldn’t even be able to\nprogram anything at all.\nSo, after that horrible, horrible July, I tried to get everything done\nduring the week and take the Sunday off, as anyone should really do. Anything\nthat cannot be realistically finished during the week, I accept that I won’t\nfinish it and push it to the next week. Basically, I was maintaining my own\nsprint cycles.

This is probably one of my\nfavorite categories too, as my girlfriend is a huge cryptography enjoyer and it\ntickles our brains.\n\nSame thing with web and forensics, this blogpost will describe the challenges\nand give the solutions to them - but I will not be giving out the flag in its\nentirety.\n\n\ninterencdec\n\nDifficulty: Easy \nCategories: base64, caesar\n\nA file is given to you, with a base64 encoded string. I will once again use\nLinux’s base64 utility:\n\nWell… another base64 string? Let’s do it again!\n\nWe have what looks like a ROT13’d flag string. Knowing that the flag is always\nin the format of picoCTF{flag}, I opened up my trusty Swiss Army Knife for\ncyber security stuff, CyberChef and used\nROT13 Brute Force on it. Typing in the known part of picoCTF and we got our\nflag!\n\nrsa_oracle\n\nDifficulty: Medium \nCategories: none\n\nOh, RSA, my beloved… The challenge gives us a ciphertext, which I assume is\nthe flag we’re supposed to decrypt, and an encoded password. There’s also an\noracle we can use to poke around for things.\nAlrighty, let’s talk RSA. This is gonna be a long solve - strap in.\n\nWhat is RSA?\nRSA is one of the oldest cryptosystem used for securing data. In simple terms,\nRSA can be summarized as below, without going too into details about how the\nkeypair is generated.\n\n\nA pair of keys are generated, one public key and one private key.\n\n\nThe public key has two parts - a modulus n and a public exponent e.\n\n\nThe private key has the private exponent d.\n\n\nTo encrypt:\n$$c = m^e \\ (\\text{mod}\\ n)$$\n\n\nTo decrypt:\n$$m = c^d \\ (\\text{mod}\\ n)$$\n\n\nSomething to note - the public exponent e that is commonly used is 65537.\n\nTesting the waters\nWith that said, let’s try plugging in 2 into the oracle, and see what it spits\nout for us.\n\nSo we do know the ciphertext for a given plaintext. I was originally going to\ntry and calculate n and d for the RSA keys, but I realized we can do a\nchosen ciphertext attack on this oracle, and see how things goes.\n\nChosen ciphertext attack\nBased on this answer on\nStackExchange, we can understand a chosen ciphertext attack as such:\n\n\nChoose a certain plaintext such as 2, and calculate:\n$$C \\equiv 2^e \\ \\text{mod} \\ n$$\n\n\nWe have the password as our original C, so we’ll send over C_b = C_a * C,\nso:\n$$C_b \\equiv C \\times 2^e \\equiv t^e 2^e \\ \\text{mod} \\ n$$\n\n\nWe decrypt C_b:\n$$(C_b)^d \\equiv (t^e 2^e)^d = [(t^e)^d \\times (2^e)^d] \\ \\text{mod} \\ n$$\n\n\nFor any plaintext x, we have C = x^e and x = C^d, so the above equation\nbecomes:\n$$(C^b)^d \\equiv (t \\times 2) \\ \\text{mod} \\ n$$\n\n\nFinally, after all of this, what this means is that, if we have the encrypted\npassword, and the encrypted ciphertext of 2, we can multiply them together,\nsend it to the oracle for decryption, and the result will be double of the\ndecrypted password that we’re looking for - in other words, halving this value\nwill give us the decrypted password.\n\nSending our decryption requests\nI will use a quick and dirty Python script, along with the excellent\npwntools library to send our\nrequests and get the password.\n\nAfter this, all we need to do is use openssl to decrypt secret.enc:\n\n","description":"","id":"https://rylie.moe/blog/picoctf-2024-cryptography/","path":"/blog/picoctf-2024-cryptography/","title":"PicoCTF 2024: Cryptography"},"https://rylie.moe/blog/picoctf-2024-forensics/":{"body":"I have had interest in cyber security and CTF-related stuff for a while now, but\nI’ve never had the time to properly learn them. Given that SekaiCTF\n2024 is starting soon, and my planned ideas edging\ncloser to things related in this field, I will be trying to prepare for it and\nspend some time learning more about it! Thanks to Bottersnike’s recommendations,\nI started doing PicoCTF’s backlog of challenges to have a\nbetter grasp at this! In this post, I will be giving writeups for the forensics\nchallenges as I go through them.\n\nThis blogpost will describe the challenges and give the solutions to them -\nbut I will not be giving out the flag in its entirety.\n\n\nVerify\n\nDifficulty: Easy \nCategories: grep, checksum\n\nIn this challenge, you’re given a folder of encrypted files, the decryption\nscript and the SHA-256 hash of the file you’re looking for. On a Linux machine,\nit’s a simple run of sha256sum on all the files in the folder, and grepping\nfor the given SHA-256 hash. Afterwards, running the decryption script on the\nfile would give you the flag you’re looking for.\n\nScan Surprise\n\nDifficulty: Easy \nCategories: shell, qrcode\n\nAs the name suggests, the challenge gives you a QR code. Simply scan the QR code\nusing your mobile device, or convert it to text using just about any QR code to\ntext converter, and you’re good to go.\n\nSecret of the Polyglot\n\nDifficulty: Easy \nCategories: file_format, polyglot\n\nThe challenge gives you a .pdf file. Attempting to open this file as-is gives\nyou… half a flag? Where’s the other part? Using file on the downloaded file\ngives you this:\n\nHmm, that’s weird. Let’s try making it a PNG file and see what happens. Changing\nthe file extension to .png and opening it with an image viewer yields the\nother half of the flag, and we’re done!\n\nLoupe (GNOME’s image viewer) gave me a hard time doing this - it kept\nrecognizing the ending half of the file as application/pdf and refused to\nopen the file, despite it having a PNG header and file extension. I had to\ndownload GIMP to open the file up to see the first half of the flag.\n\n\nCanYouSee\n\nDifficulty: Easy \nCategories: none\n\nThis challenge gives you a .zip file, which contains a .jpg image inside.\nOpening the image doesn’t really show anything that’s irregular - no signs of\nsteganography, at least, to the naked eye. Maybe there’s something in the\nmetadata? Using exiftool on the extracted .jpg gives us this:\n\nOoh, the attribution URL looks interesting. That’s a base64 encoded string!\nLet’s try decoding this! There are many ways to do it, but I use Linux’s\nbase64 utility as such:\n\nThat gives us the flag for the challenge!\n\nBlast from the past\n\nDifficulty: Medium \nCategories: metadata\n\nAn image is given by the challenge, and your task is to set all the timestamps\nto 1970:01:01 00:00:00.001+00:00 (that’s one millisecond after the start of\nthe Unix epoch!) with as much precision as possible. Using exiftool once\nagain, we can set the majority of the dates using exiftool \"-AllDates=1970:01:01 00:00:00.001+00:00\" original.jpg. This comes with its\ndownside - the subsecond creation date, original date/time and modify date will\nbe off in the milliseconds. Once again, use exiftool to change those dates to\nmatch the precise timestamp. After this, submit the file to the checker program.\nWe’ve obtained the flag, that’s done– Until we haven’t. You will see one last\ntimestamp tag that we’ll need to set - the Samsung: TimeStamp tag. This pesky\ntimestamp is not writable through exiftool, so we’ll need another tool for the\njob. But, just to be sure, let’s run the file through exiftool one last time,\nbut this time we’ll increase the verbosity all the way up.\n\nOooh, we’re seeing something! The Samsung: TimeStamp tag is stored in the file\nunder hex - and it’s simply the Unix timestamp in milliseconds! Using any hex\neditor - I use GHex for simplicity’s sake, find the bytes shown in exiftool’s\noutput: 31 37 30 30 35 31 33 31 38 31 34 32 30, and edit it to be 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 31, which is what we need the timestamp to be.\nSubmitting the file one final time, and we’re finally done with this one.\n\nMob psycho\n\nDifficulty: Medium \nCategories: apk\n\nAn .apk file. We all know these are glorified .zip files. Let’s unzip\nthis, and see what’s inside. Unzipping the given APK, there’s nothing too out\nof the ordinary for this directory structure. Everything is there, everything\nlooks fine, so far nothing too special.\nI am not going to scroll through and go into each directory to find files, so\nI’ll just run a simple find in the directory. Scrolling through the results\nand… “./res/color/flag.txt? Is this it? Printing out the file content gives\nwhat looks like a hexadecimal string. Let’s run this through a hexadecimal to\nASCII converter aaaaand… there’s our flag!\n\nendianess-v2\n\nDifficulty: Medium \nCategories: none\n\nThe challenge gives us another weird file. Running file gives nothing, and it\ndoesn’t look like anything opens it up correctly either. It’s time to take a\nlook at it once again in a hex editor. GHex gives me a very interesting first\nline… E0 FF D8 FF 46 4A 10 00 01 00 46 49 01 00 00 00, the ASCII\nrepresentation of which is ....FJ....FI..... Wait… Isn’t this the JFIF\nheader but flipped? It looks like every four bytes is flipped around, if you\ncompare it to the correct JFIF header: FF D8 FF E0 .. .. 4A 46 49 46 00 .. (of\nwhich .. is some hex value). The block of E0 FF D8 FF is reversed, and so on\nfor every other chunk of 4 bytes.\nI guess it’s time for a Python script or something, as rewriting this by hand\nis… basically impossible.\n\nNot the cleanest Python code, I know. A quick check with file shows that we’ve\ngot the file correctly:\n\nAnd opening it would result in our flag!\n\nThere remains one more challenge unsolved - and that’s Dear Diary - a disk\nimage challenge. As of writing this post right now (August 1, 2024) I am too\nlazy to really go look at it, so this would be all my solutions for now.\nThanks a ton to making through to the end!\n\n","description":"","id":"https://rylie.moe/blog/picoctf-2024-forensics/","path":"/blog/picoctf-2024-forensics/","title":"PicoCTF 2024: Forensics"},"https://rylie.moe/blog/picoctf-2024-web/":{"body":"I have considered myself… practically done with the Forensics category for\nPicoCTF 2024.

Nothing in the home\npage, so I’ll go into the About page.\nAnd upon loading the About page, wow, the very loud text saying “Try\ninspecting the page!!

Let’s try… removing that and see what happens!\nAfter removing the OTP code from the form data, we got ourselves a nice\nmalformed… well… form data sent over the wire. Let’s see how the server\nreacts… And we got our flag!\n\nTrickster\n\nDifficulty: Medium \nCategories: none\n\nThis is actually… a pretty tough one if you don’t know where to immediately\nstart. I opened up the site that the challenge gave, and there was no clear\nentry points to… anything, really. Uploading a PNG only gets a result string\nshown to you, like below.\n\nI tried accessing a random directory, e.g. atlas.picoctf.net:&lt;port&gt;/what, and\nI got a 404 Not Found. That’s expected. I also see this is running Apache, which\nmeans… there’s PHP. But we haven’t seen any clear entry points to get an\narbitrary PHP script running here.\nLet’s get back to the root site. Sitting here won’t do us any good, I guess it’s\ntime to use some tools? Using gobuster, and running a brute-force for URIs\nlike such:\n\nWe’re seeing robots.txt that we can access, and /uploads being redirected to\nthe root directory - looks like there’s gonna be an accessible folder there.\nLet’s try accessing robots.txt…\n\nSo the very root directory of /uploads/ is not crawled, along with the file\ninstructions.txt. Let’s try looking at instructions.txt.\n\nInteresting… It looks like this doesn’t do much validation on the PNG files\nthemselves, other than checking for the .png extension existing in the file\nname, and the first few bytes containing PNG. I guess the uploaded files will\nalso be stored under /uploads/&lt;file_name&gt;? That’s an entry for our PHP now,\nno?\nI will modify\neasy-simple-php-webshell\na tiny bit, so it has the magic bytes for PNG at the top.\n\nAlong with that, I’ll add the .png extension, saving it as webshell.png.php\nso it passes the extension check. Let’s try uploading this. The form accepted it\nwithout any complaints! Time to try accessing this webshell under\n/uploads/webshell.png.php.\nWe’re in. Let’s try running ls ../ to see the root directory. There’s a weird\nfile with the name MQZWCYZWGI2WE.txt. A simple cat on this file finally\ngives us the flag we’re looking for!\n\nAfterwords\nThe final challenge of this category - titled “elements”, honestly deserves a\npost of its own. It’s of another level, and I’ve never seen myself so stuck on\none. With that being said, that’s practically all the solvable web challenges\nfor PicoCTF 2024 as of writing this post.

I felt like writing more Rust, so I ended up choosing the\npoise framework, built on top of the\nserenity library.\nWhy Rust? I feel like I can grasp the language decently well, as well as write\nidiomatic code fast enough in it. Of course, I have my own qualms about it\nregarding async Rust as well as how ugly it gets when you want something like\nglobal states… but that’s for another time.\nOn top of this, I feel like I should learn to write my own command engine and\neverything… but for now, we’ll stick with Poise. Poise is opinionated, yes,\nbut it is neat in the sense that for most, if not all of my use cases, it\nworks and I don’t have to think too much about the structure of everything,\nsimilar to how Tairitsu was.\n\nPlanning features\nI’ve always wanted to make something that can manage the self-assignable roles\nin my server. I have a few of them set up - colors, gaming pings, free games\nnotifications, etc. Setting them up through Tatsu feels like\na pain - and guiding people to use them isn’t the easiest either. That’s why I\nfelt like making my own to see what’s the best way to get the user experience\nright.\nOn top of this, I also want to manage new chapter uploads from\nMangaDex, as well as a recommendation list for manga.\nI’ve had ideas about it for a good while, making a crowd-sourced list of manga\nthat we can say “oh yeah our server endorse this, this is pretty nice”,\nsomething in those lines. Using a Google spreadsheet feels very manual, though\nit definitely shines when you want someone to add their comments for a certain\ntitle, for example.\nSo, in short, we have two things to do.\n\nSelf-assignable roles\n\nDisplay a list\nAdd and remove roles\n\n\nMangaDex chapter tracking\n\nDisplay list of tracked manga\nAdd manga to tracked list\nSend notifications whenever a new chapter is out for the titles on the\nlist\n\n\n\n\nGetting to work\nWell… Looking at the two above planned features, for starters, the\nself-assignable roles look much more simple to implement, and that’s where I\nstarted first.\n\nSelf-assignable roles\nI prepared a little database table with two columns, role_name and role_id.\nThe role’s name is for display purposes through Discord’s select\nmenu, and\nthe role_id is… well, for assigning it to the user through Poise, of course.\nOf course, with hindsight, I could always only store the role ID, and use the\nDiscord API to fetch the role name for displaying purposes. This way, I wouldn’t\nneed to trust myself (out of all people!) to keep the role names correct and\nupdated. But at the same time, we haven’t changed any of our self-assignable\nroles in a good while, maybe a year or two now, so this is the least of my\nconcerns.\nSeems simple enough, right? Whatever roles I wanted to setup, I’ll fill in the\nname and the role ID into the database. Then, the role list command would\nfetch everything from the database and display it in a neat little embed.\nSimilarly, role add would display that same list and having a dropdown to\nselect a role. role remove would display the list of self-assignable roles you\nhave, and allowing you to pick one to remove from your own roles.\nSure enough, implementing this was simple and it didn’t take long to get it\nworking. I don’t have to worry about managing multiple servers and everything -\nafter all, this was meant to be a personal Discord bot! That’s the reason why a\nlot of supposedly scalable design decisions were skipped - no tracking of what\nserver ID the roles are from, no real interface to add roles to the database\nfrom the bot, and so on.\n\nManga tracking\nNow this is the fun part. Thanks to the\nmangadex-api crate, I have a neat API\nclient for MangaDex that I could use to fetch stuff from. But, now what? Where\ndo we start?\nOnce again, I started with managing the manga list, which also doubles up as our\ncrowd-sourced recommendations list. Database-wise, it’s just a simple table with\ntwo columns: manga_dex_id and last_updated. The MangaDex UUID of the manga\nwill be stored alongside the latest date we checked for new updates.\nOf course, of course, “But but “last updated” means the last date the manga was\nupdated“, I hear you say. Yes, the naming could be better, but who cares? I\nmight change it when I feel like it confuses me enough, but for now, the field\nexisting at all is what I really care about.\nA manga list command is available to render the entire list. As of this point,\nI was really lazy so I didn’t bother with pagination or anything. I only have a\nfew titles in the list, so it’s not like it’s going to be a problem, right?\nThe manga add command is up next - I’ll let users input either a MangaDex URL\nor the UUID of the manga on MD, and we’ll add it to the database. At the same\ntime, the bot takes a MDList UUID and for every manga added it will attempt to\nsync the database to the MDList.\nSkipping the remove for now because… truth be told I cannot figure out a good\nUX to remove stuff… I’ll just hook straight into the database and remove\nentries I guess.\n\nClosing thoughts\nAs of right now, Miki Sayaka is up and running pretty neatly! Of course, there’s\nstill plenty more to do - paginating the lists, actually notifying new chapters,\nand so on. But for now, this is a good starting place for Sayaka! Source code\nfor the bot is always available on the GitHub\nrepo, feel free to check it out! Thanks a\nlot for reading!\n","description":"","id":"https://rylie.moe/blog/sayaka-dev-01/","path":"/blog/sayaka-dev-01/","title":"Miki Sayaka Devblog 001: Off to A Strong Start!"},"https://rylie.moe/blog/sayaka-dev-02/":{"body":"Four months\nago,\nI started working on Sayaka, with some simple features to kick it off with. I\noriginally planned to write a weekly-ish devblog, with the first entry being\ntwo months ago, but… being a combination of my laziness with\nhow fast Sayaka was moving at that point, it was a rather impossible feat for me\nto do.\nSo, two months later from that last post, where are we? I’m happy to say Sayaka\nhas managed to bump one whole major version (!!!) and we’ve improved quite a\nlot from where we started.\n\nPagination\nTo start off with, Sayaka has proper pagination now. As of the time of writing,\nshe’s currently tracking about 115 manga titles. Using s&gt;manga list now gives\nyou a neat little embed like so, with buttons to change pages.\n\nThis… unfortunately isn’t available (yet) in the self-roles commands…\nbecause I’m lazy… I’ll get around to it sometimes, I swear. It doesn’t see a\nwhole lot of uses because Nazunacord itself doesn’t see much activity and we’re\nall admins, but I cannot check\nthis off as finished until I do\nit…\n\nLink parser\nSayaka also got a neat feature, matching any MangaDex link posted to the Discord\nchannel to read data for!\n\nI originally let MangaDex’s original embed sorta coexist with Sayaka’s: MangaDex\nwould have the description, the cover art, while Sayaka would have all the\ninformation. But, after a while it cluttered up pretty quickly. So… it took me\nlike… two hours… to figure out how to remove another user’s embed from the\nbot’s side. I merged up the cover thumbnail, as well as the description, and\nthere we have it!\n\nChapter tracker\nWhile I was at it, I also figured out how to neatly create a chapter tracker /\nnotifier as originally planned too!\n\nOriginally, I implemented this by using a webhook, as I couldn’t figure out\nhow to send a message through the bot client created by poise. Afterwards, I\nspent a lot of time trying to figure out, even thinking of using a MPSC channel\nto fire things from the tracker task to the bot client.\nAfter a good while figuring out the internals of the types used in poise and\nserenity, I realized… it’s all Arc&lt;T&gt; under the hood… The solution then? I\ncloned the Arc&lt;Http&gt; instance from the\nbot\nand just used it to send messages, as I already know the Discord channel I’ll be\nsending notifications into in the first place. This ends up making me really\nappreciate Rust and the Arc&lt;T&gt; type. Nothing beats being able to just do:\n\nand it just fucking works. I don’t even have to worry about it being\nthread-unsafe as it’s all atomically reference-counted, and cloning is free.\nIt’s amazing!\n\nさようなら, slash commands!\nI’ve also decided to pull the plug on slash\ncommands.\nWhy? I personally don’t use it, and no one really does in the server it’s made\nfor anyways. I feel like it would end up being a pain in the ass to maintain if\nI ever added some funky features that required a lot of arguments parsing, as my\nfriend beerpsi had suffered writing extra features for his own bot…\n\nTime for a rant on slash commands and the general state of the Discord API.\nThe more I write Discord bots, the more I seem to dislike it, or at least, how\noften it’s slightly changing.\n\nNow that I’m no longer one to be impressed by the shiny, latest™\ntechnologies, (and this is probably a lukewarm\ntake at this point) I’ve come to realize Discord slash commands are one\nof the worst things to ever be created by mankind.\nPersonally, I very much dislike slash commands, as it’s lumping all available\nbot commands under the same namespace and… tell me how you’re quickly using a\ncommmand at a glance if there are five hundred bots using the same /status?\nThe API changes very often in very subtle ways, especially surrounding the whole\npermissions / privileges thing. Maybe I’m not the one looking out for Discord\nAPI changes, but I swear that these are not clearly stated anywhere when\nthey actually do change it.\nEverything feels very inconsistent, from the way the APIs are designed to handle\nslash commands vs. prefix commands, and how to respond to those as well, it\nfeels horrible and unwieldy to write code for, and that is reflected down to the\nlibraries.\nYes, you can argue that prefix commands are being phased out by Discord and\nthat’s why they feel horrible to use, but honestly writing a slash-first bot\nisn’t much easier either - they categorize a lot of stuff in very weird ways\nthat would wind you in reading a lot of badly-documented documentations. Not\nthe best of impressions, after I spent more than 24 hours attempting to write\nsomething that leveraged those features.\n\nFuture?\nI’m not too sure what’s going to be next for Sayaka. Feature-wise, she’s\ngenerally complete, and I’m not too keen on expanding her far too much beyond\nher original scope.\nA neat thing could be that s&gt;manga sync also manually triggering the chapter\ntracker - but I have yet to figure out a method to lock the entire tracking\nprocess to only run once at any given time.\nOf course… there’s implementing pagination for the roles list too… I’ll get\nto it I promise… It should just be the same code but changing the content\nstrings… I think.\nI think I would also spend some time doing configuration stuff, right now the\nchapter tracker is straight up hardcoded to be two hours, and sometimes I want\nto lower it, but I keep forgetting to do so as well.\nFinally, thanks for reading to the end. Source code for Sayaka is always\navailable on my GitHub!\n","description":"","id":"https://rylie.moe/blog/sayaka-dev-02/","path":"/blog/sayaka-dev-02/","title":"Miki Sayaka Devblog 002: Two Months Later"},"https://rylie.moe/blog/sekai-decompiling/":{"body":"One random day, I got myself hooked up in Project Sekai again. Well… not for a\nlong enough time - friends actually got me hooked into World Dai Star, and\nthat game is much better in terms of charting. Anyways, I find my reading\nskill to have gone up after grinding out 16.25 in CHUNITHM, but executing\npatterns and actually getting APs still turns out to be a challenge for me.\n\nThough, being a person who’s insanely autistic in terms of looking at stats, I\ndid end up asking around on whether there’s any solutions for score tracking for\nProject Sekai. Less so out of actual interest in tracking my own progression,\nmore so out of curiosity on how it’s done. My friend\nbeerpsi mentioned a Discord bot for it, using the\nsave from the data transfer feature. Checking that bot’s source code out, I let\nout a loud “awwwww…” as I saw the note:\n\nThis repository hides the requirements.txt, as well as all PJSK API-based\ncode. This will not be made publicly available, due to the sensitive nature of\nthe game’s API.\n\nTime to take matters into my own hands! Knowing that the game runs on Unity\n20221, with a little bit of Unity reverse engineering knowledge, I feel like\nthis wouldn’t be too difficult… Or so I thought.\n\n    \n    \n        NOTE\n        This is clearly not meant to be an encompassing\ntutorial! I don’t think I’m entirely correct throughout my journey, but I will\ntry to document everything I tried and thought of!\n\n    \n\n\nUnity? What’s that?\nUnity is a cross-platform game engine, often used for mobile games, with C# as\nits primary programming language. Given the nature of C#, usually the game code\nis compiled into what is called Intermediate Language (IL) to be loaded into the\nUnity runtime. One neat thing about IL is, it can be decompiled back into C#\ncode, with the help of tools like ILSpy\nor dnSpy. This file is often named\nAssembly-CSharp.dll, and stored under the Managed directory somewhere.\nSo what’s the catch? Well, to really see how things are, let’s take a look at\nthe game’s APK. I snatched the game off APKPure, and it comes as an XAPK - which\nis just a fancy name for a ZIP file containing the main APK,\narchitecture-specific code and other assets.\n\nNothing interesting within com.sega.pjsekai.apk, outside of the various system\nlibraries that the game uses, so I’ll take a look at the other APK file,\nconfig.arm64_v8a.apk.\nDigging around for a little bit, I found myself stumbling upon… nothing?\nWhere’s my Assembly-CSharp.dll? All I see is a ton of .so files… What’s\ngoing on?\n\n\nIL2CPPain…\nAs it turns out, Unity has given developers the choice to make the game code\nexported as a native library, using what is called IL2CPP. This allows the game\nto run in environments that disallow just-in-time2 runtimes, e.g. iOS.\nIL2CPP, in short, compiles all the IL code into C++ code, then said C++ code is\nused to compile into a native binary ahead-of-time3, in this case,\nlibil2cpp.so. The most important thing for us here is that this strips away\nall the goodness that comes with IL, like symbol names and readable function\nbodies, as this is all going to be heavily optimized and stripped by the C++\ncompiler.\nFor the developers, this is heaven (or so we’ll assume, to be determined later).\nFor us, this is hell. If you jumped straight in and, say, put this output binary\nstraight into a disassembler like Ghidra or IDA Pro, you’re in for a very rough\ntime.\n\nLess pain, more gain?\nThankfully though, Unity still keeps something lying around for us to use. Meet\nglobal-metadata.dat. “What is this?”, I hear you ask. This file contains all\nthe .NET metadata for the game, including definitions and symbols for all the\ntypes, methods, etc. This is an incredibly useful source of information for\nus.\nAs mentioned earlier, this is what makes IL2CPP not quite the heaven for\ndevelopers who really, really don’t want their game to be\nreverse-engineered. All the metadata is still available in one single file,\nwhich can be used to reverse-engineer the game’s code. It takes a lot of effort\nto hide this file away or somehow make it inaccessible.\n\n    \n    \n        NOTE\n        If you want to know more about this, feel free\nto take a look at djkaty’s blog post on IL2CPP\nmetadata. Their blog\nposts have been an incredibly helpful read on how to approach the project!\n\n    \n\n\nRight, now that I’ve found it… how do we really use this for anything? I\nwanted to use Il2CppInspector, but\nthe game seems to be too new for it, as the last update for this was in 2021,\nand the game just moved to Unity 2022 very recently. A bit of extra digging\nbrings me to Il2CppDumper, which is\nanother tool with similar features. Surely, by passing this and libil2cpp.so\nto Il2CppDumper, we can dump the assembly, right? Right…?\n\nThe battle finally starts…\nPassing in both the binary and the metadata file gave me…\n\nThat’s weird. Why are we getting an error? Invalid metadata? Thanks to another\nblog post by\ndjkaty,\nwe know that the metadata file should start with the magic bytes AF 1B B1 FA, followed by the version number of the metadata file. Let’s check out the\none we extracted from the game, by opening it in a hex editor.\n\nRight. This isn’t it. It’s encrypted. It’s easy enough to figure out that the\ngame will need to decrypt this at runtime to properly initialize the game, so\nmy first thought is to get myself a memory dump of the game’s process. Surely\nthere are better ways out there, including seeing how the actual encryption is\nperformed, but let’s leave it to another day.\n\nIntroducing Frida\nLet’s get ourselves familiar with the tools we’ll use: Frida and objection.\nFrida is a dynamic instrumentation toolkit that allows you\nto hook onto running processes, so you could dynamically modify the behavior of\nthe process. We won’t need to do anything too special here, other than getting\nit hooked up just enough to read memory from the game’s process.\nobjection is a toolkit, powered by\nFrida, that allows you to explore the state of a mobile app’s process.\nI used Android Studio’s AVD to run the game in an emulator. Do note that you\nwill need to use a system image that doesn’t have Google Play installed - these\nwill allow adbd to run as root, so you could run frida-server. I also used\nrootAVD to get myself a pre-rooted Android\nimage with Magisk on it.\nWith the emulator running and rooted as above, we can start up frida-server on\nthe emulator:\n\n\n    \n    \n        NOTE\n        Make sure that frida-server is downloaded and\nextracted, as well as matching the version of Frida installed in your\nenvironment.\n\n    \n\nAfter starting up, let’s try listing all the processes on the emulator…\n\nSweet! Our setup is all working. I also installed the game on the device as\nwell, shown by the “プロセカ” app with the identifier com.sega.pjsekai. Let’s\nlaunch the game and read its memory with objection.\n\nAnd… the game restarted. Thankfully, we don’t have to worry too much about it\n\nobjection managed to keep itself loaded within the process, so we can continue\nour investigation. We’re now greeted by objection’s prompt, and we can start to\ndo plenty of things here!\n\nLet’s remind ourselves of what we know so far of global-metadata.dat:\n\nIt has all the metadata for the game code, including definitions and symbols\nfor everything within the C# code.\nIt should start with AF 1B B1 FA.\nIt should be loaded entirely into memory upon the game’s initialization.\n\nUsing objection, we can search for the above pattern within the memory using the\ncommand memory search \"af 1b b1 fa\".\n\nWell, that was easy. It doesn’t look like Colorful Palette did any magical\ntricks to block memory reading. Let’s try and dump this out and hope that they\nalso didn’t do any magic that breaks up the file within the game’s memory… The\ncommand we will need is memory dump from_base &lt;address&gt; &lt;size to dump&gt; &lt;output&gt;. If you noticed earlier, the size of global-metadata.dat is\n25,041,580 bytes, so let’s put that as the size to dump.\n\n\n    \n    \n        NOTE\n        During the recreation process for the above\noutput, I mistakenly typed 26041580 as the size to dump and objection ended up\ndying… Looks like the file is allocated right at the edge of the game’s\nmemory, so any attempts at reading beyond that will give you an access\nviolation.\n\n    \n\nLooks like we got something out of it. Let’s see if this is exactly the\nglobal-metadata.dat we’ve been trying to extract.\nPutting it into Il2CppDumper didn’t seem to give any problems, and we got a\nbunch of files and the recreated assemblies. Let’s move on ahead.\n\nUnveiling the secrets\nNow that we have our recreated assemblies and various files, let’s bring in our\nactual big guns and see what we can do.\nIntroducing, Ghidra. This is a suite of software\nreverse engineering tools, including a disassembler and a decompiler, like I’ve\nbriefly mentioned earlier. This will be our main tool to discover the secrets\nhidden within.\nFrom the output of Il2CppDumper, what do we get?\n\nThe set of restored .dll files, which we can inspect using any .NET\ndecompiler tool.\nil2cpp.h, a header file containing all the structures information.\nscript.json, a JSON file containing the metadata that we can load into our\ndisassembler of choice.\nghidra_with_struct.py, a script to be loaded into Ghidra to load the above\nscript.json file.\n\nThere’s also il2cpp_header_to_ghidra.py, we will need this to convert the\nabove il2cpp.h into a Ghidra-compatible format, as there are minor differences\nbetween the format that IDA Pro takes and Ghidra’s.\nLet’s start with converting the header file into Ghidra’s format.\n\nCool, that was painless. Time to open Ghidra. Create yourself a new project in\nGhidra, and let’s load in libil2cpp.so to the project. While opening up the\nbinary in CodeBrowser, make sure to not analyze the binary immediately. This\nwill slow Ghidra down massively since this is a very large binary, and we want\nto load in the metadata first before we do any decompilation.\nLet’s continue with parsing the C header that we obtained above\n(il2cpp_ghidra.h) into our Ghidra project. Go to File &gt; Parse C Source within\nCodeBrowser’s interface. You will see something like below:\n\nGet rid of all the files in the “Source files to parse” section, as well as\n“Include paths” and clear out the options within “Parse Options”. Then, you want\nto add il2cpp_ghidra.h into “Source files to parse”, as well as putting in\n-D_GHIDRA_ into “Parse Options”. Feel free to save it into another profile - I\nhave mine saved as il2cpp.prf. This is what it should look like:\n\nNow hit “Parse to Program” and give it a bit… This “bit” will depend on how\ngood your CPU is… My measly i5-1240P took a good while.\nNext, let’s add the ghidra_with_struct.py script into the Script Manager\n(Window &gt; Script Manager). Run it and pass in the script.json from earlier. If\nnothing has gone wrong from parsing the C header file, the script should’ve\nloaded in all the metadata into the decompilation!\n\nAfter another bit of Ghidra decompiling the functions (like 12 hours of\ndecompiling), you should get something like the above, and you’re now free to\nsnoop around for things!\n\nConclusions\nSo, what did we end up with? A decompiled libil2cpp.so for the inner workings\nof the game, as well as a stubbed Assembly-CSharp.dll for an easy view into\nthe various structs used. This is a great starting point to dive deeper into the\ngame’s code.\nOnce again, this is less so a formal tutorial, more so my own notes to approach\nUnity decompilation, and I managed to learn a whole lot from this! I might come\naround and snoop further into things, but for now, this is a wrap for our\njourney. See you next time… maybe.\n\n\n\nhttps://x.com/pjsekai_eng/status/1786372022307557495 ↩\n\n\nA compilation process where code is compiled from intermediate\nrepresentations into machine code at runtime. ↩\n\n\nAn optimization technique that compiles intermediate representations like\nIL into native machine code before execution, so the resulting binary can be\nexecuted natively instead of within a provided runtime, as well as reducing\nthe amount of work performed during runtime. ↩\n\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://rylie.moe/blog/sekai-decompiling/","path":"/blog/sekai-decompiling/","title":"Suffering on Discord at 17:00 - Decompiling Project Sekai: Colorful Stage! feat. Hatsune Miku"},"https://rylie.moe/blog/understanding-maimai-rating-system/":{"body":"(Update 01/12/2022: As pointed out by Amasugi,\nmaimai でらっくす’s ranking doesn’t have the E-F ranks anymore, instead replaced\nby BB and BBB. I’ve updated the table below to reflect that!)\n(Update 26/02/2024: Updated a few things because I know more about the game\nnow!)\nI have been playing maimai でらっくす for a couple of months a while now,\nand personally, I am very intrigued by the internal workings of the game. After\nworking on Tachi’s maimai でらっくす\nimplementation, I started learning about the game’s internal rating system. This\npost will focus on exactly that, from the very bottom up.\n\nWhat is this “Rating” you’re talking about?\nLet’s start by understanding “rating”. In maimai でらっくす, for every\ndifficulty of a song (hereby referred to as “chart”) played, there will be an\ninteger rating associated to it, depending on multiple factors. Each account\nwill have a total rating, usually used as a metric to gauge progress and skill\nlevel. This total rating number can only increase, not decrease, as higher\nscored and harder charts gets played on that account. For each total rating\nrange, there will be also a colored plate representing that range. In the\ncommunity, it is referred to as below:\nColorTotal rating range\nWhite0-999\nBlue1000-1999\nGreen2000-3999\nYellow4000-6999\nRed7000-9999\nPurple10000-11999\nBronze12000-12999\nSilver13000-13999\nGold14000-14499\nPlatinum14500-14999\nRainbow15000+\n\n\nSo, how is this “rating” calculated?\nWe can start with the easier one out of everything: total rating. An account’s\ntotal rating is made up of two parts, New Charts’ ratings, and Old Charts’\nratings. These ratings only accomodate for the best records on that account, and\nwill not change if you achieve a downscore on the same chart.\nNew Charts\n\nNew Charts are charts that are added in the latest title version (i.e.\nUniverse, Universe Plus, etc.)\nThe top 15 ratings are listed here.\n\nOld Charts\n\nOld Charts are charts that are added in previous title versions.\nThe top 35 ratings are listed here.\n\nThe formula for total rating is given below:\n$$\\text{Total Rating} = S_N + S_B$$\n\n$S_N$ is the sum of all Ratings in New Charts.\n$S_B$ is the sum of all Ratings in Old Charts.\n\nWith that out of the way, we can now get into how each chart’s rating is\ncalculated. Chart ratings are calculated with the formula given below:\n$$\\text{Chart Rating} = \\lfloor\\text{Chart Constant} \\times \\text{Score} \\times\n\\text{Rank Multiplier}\\rfloor$$\nThis formula shows that there are three relevant quantities when it comes to\ncalculating the Chart Rating. Each of the sections below will proceed to explain\neach of them.\n\nChart Constant\nIn the game, each chart is assigned an integer difficulty level, ranging\nfrom 1-15. Between level 7-15, there are also intermediate levels, with a plus\nadded to them to better distinguish charts’ difficulties (e.g. 7+, 8+, 9+,\netc.).\nIf you looked at this, you would assume that all charts of the same difficulty\nlevel are actually of the same difficulty. This is a false assumption, as\ninternally, each chart is assigned a decimal level for them. Given a\ndifficulty level $X$, its internal level will range between $X.0$ to $X.6$,\nwhile $X+$ will range from $X.7$ to $X.9$.\nThese values are usually derived from the rating changes observed when finishing\na chart ingame, using the above formula, but finding for $\\text{Chart\nConstant}$. For those who has access to the game files, this is also defined in\nthe chart’s XML file as well.\n\nScore\nThis is just the score you obtained, converted to a decimal. So, for example,\n100% will have a value of 1, and 101% will have a value of 1.01. With maimai で\nらっくす’s system, score will always have a maximum value of 101%, whereas\nmaimai FiNALE scores will have a maximum value depending on the amount of BREAK\nnotes found in the chart.\nThis writeup will not go deep into how scores in both games are calculated, as\nit is not the focus of what we are discussing.\nAnother thing to note is all scores above 100.5% will be treated as 100.5%, so\nthe rating algorithm essentially caps out at 100.5% if you are aiming to\nmaximize rating for your scores.\n\nRank Multiplier\nFor maimai でらっくす, SEGA has opted for a rank-based multiplier, instead of a\nmore linear multiplier like in CHUNITHM. This means your rating will increase\nwith each rank, while small score increments will usually not result in a rating\nincrease.\nRankMultiplier\nSSS+22.4\nSSS21.6\nSS+21.1\nSS20.8\nS+20.3\nS20\nAAA16.8\nAA15.2\nA13.6\nBBB12\nBB11.2\nB9.6\nC8\nD5\n\n\nConclusions\nWith all three main parts of the formula and the total rating explained, I feel\nlike this is enough for a wrap-up. For now, this should be everything that is\nneeded to understand and work with maimai でらっくす’s rating system.\n","description":"","id":"https://rylie.moe/blog/understanding-maimai-rating-system/","path":"/blog/understanding-maimai-rating-system/","title":"Understanding maimaiでらっくす's Rating System"},"https://rylie.moe/blog/wargames-bandit-0-to-7/":{"body":"Well, here we are again, in the middle of the night - I am bored and I am\npreparing for idekCTF 2024. What’s better than sitting\nand solving some more CTF stuff? I’m gonna start with\nBandit - and go all the way up\nslowly as per the recommended order on the Wargames\nhomepage.\nThe first few levels (or Bandit itself, really) are really simple - mostly about\nteaching you about Unix/Linux utilities, and various other tools you might need\nwhile doing CTF challenges.\n\nLevel 0\n\nThe goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to\nwhich you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220.\nThe username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in,\ngo to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.\n\nWell, the idea is clear. Connect through SSH using:\n\nFill in the given password at the prompt, and you’re in!\n\nLevel 0 -&gt; Level 1\n\nThe password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located\nin the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH.\nWhenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into\nthat level and continue the game.\n\nSimple enough! Let’s use cat to read the file readme.\n\nA quick exit to get out, let’s connect to level 1.\n\nLevel 1 -&gt; Level 2\n\nThe password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in\nthe home directory.\n\nAlright, we got the password from the previous level. Let’s connect in through\nSSH.\n\nAt the password prompt, I will use the password I got from the previous level.\nThe filename, as given by the problem, is - - a special character. I will\nstill use cat, but escape the filename with a backslash \\ so cat properly\nunderstands the filename.\n\nWe’re done! Let’s get out and move on to level 3.\n\nLevel 2 -&gt; Level 3\n\nThe password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this\nfilename located in the home directory.\n\nStill a simple challenge. Anyone can cat files that have spaces in their names\nby wrapping the entire path in quotes. Let’s give this a try.\n\nWe’re done!\n\nLevel 3 -&gt; Level 4\n\nThe password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere\ndirectory.\n\nHidden directories huh… Let’s put ourselves into the inhere directory first,\nand try printing the directory listing.\n\nNothing. I know just the trick for this - the -a option for ls.\n\nAha. Let’s cat out our password, and get out.\n\n\nLevel 4 -&gt; Level 5\n\nThe password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in\nthe inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset”\ncommand.\n\nLet’s start by cding into the inhere directory again. I will use the file\ncommand to see the types of the file - “human-readable” is a hint from the\nproblem text.\n\nThere’s only one file with the type “ASCII text” - let’s cat it!\n\n\nLevel 5 -&gt; Level 6\n\nThe password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the\ninhere directory and has all of the following properties:\n\nhuman-readable\n1033 bytes in size\nnot executable\n\n\nLet’s try printing the directory listing.\n\nRight… There’s a lot of folders, and possibly files. But don’t fret! A Linux\nutility is available for us to help us out with this - find.\n\nDangit. That’s a whole lot of files. Let’s check the problem text and see the\nrequirements. It has to be a human-readable file, and it has to be 1033 bytes in\nsize. It also has to be non-executable, but we will skip that for now. find\nprovides a few filters to help us out with this - -type f allows us to only\nsearch for files, skipping all directories, while -size 1033c filters out\nfiles with the precise size of 1033 bytes (yes, the c suffix is for bytes!).\nLet’s see it in action.\n\nOnly one file - we can also do a few checks on the file to see if it matches up\nwith the rest of the description.\n\nYup, precisely what we wanted - ASCII text, 1033 bytes, and non-executable, by\nthe lack of the x bit on the permissions. Let’s cat it to see the content,\nand away we go!.\n\nLevel 6 -&gt; Level 7\n\nThe password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all\nof the following properties:\n\nowned by user bandit7\nowned by group bandit6\n33 bytes in size\n\n\nSounds like another find! Finding by user and group would be hard, but\nthankfully, find also provides us filters for all those operations! -user &lt;user&gt; and -group &lt;group&gt; filter files owned by that user and group,\nrespectively!\n\nAmidst a sea of permission denied, we see a file that doesn’t have that\nproblem! Let’s cat the file to see its content, and let’s move on to the next\nlevel.\n\n","description":"","id":"https://rylie.moe/blog/wargames-bandit-0-to-7/","path":"/blog/wargames-bandit-0-to-7/","title":"Wargames - Bandit (Levels 0 to 7)"},"https://rylie.moe/blog/yuru-camp/":{"body":"I’ll be honest, I’m a gigantic sucker for slice-of-life anime. My anime\nlist is literally\nchock-full of slice-of-life, with only a few selective shounens here and there.\nMost of the slice-of-life stuff are, as expected, mundane, basic and niche. But,\none slice-of-life anime that truly struck different from everything else, is\nYuru Camp.\n\nPremise\nSo, what is Yuru Camp? It’s an anime about a group of girls who form a camping\nclub at their school, and it’s just about that. Camping, as it is, not just as a\nside activity or as something to build the characters upon. The anime just\nfocuses around camping as an experience, no tension, no drama, that’s it. It’s a\nvery straightforward anime with what it wants to cover and evolve.\nIn my opinion, this is what makes Yuru Camp really good. It doesn’t have\nsomething that people would just outright, “hate”, because from its premise,\nYuru Camp just feels like a very comfortable show that anyone can get into.\nPeople can dislike it, but it wasn’t a type of “controversial” anime that has\nsomething that would really spark hatred, so those people who did were probably\nnot vocal about it. But then, trying to sell Yuru Camp to others is also just as\nhard, because it seems like there is no appeal for a show that’s just harmless,\nfun and chill compared to something else with (comparatively) more memorable\nemotional moments.\nHonestly, you cannot just recommend Yuru Camp to a skeptical person as it is.\nYou have to show them how it actually feels to sit down and watch an episode of\nit. The quiet environment that it gives out is just soothing, just like having\nthose ASMR audios in the background, but it’s definitely more visual. Pure\ncalmness of mind, no more, no less.\n\nVisuals\nOf course, to say that the premise carried everything in the series is\ndefinitely a mistake. Each episode is carefully crafted and executed properly,\nand there isn’t anything that would make you feel, “oh wow, this is sooooo out\nof place.”\nThe visuals are an instant praise, honestly. The backgrounds are super detailed,\nand they’re just amazing wallpaper material. I cannot stop taking screenshots of\nthose landscape camera pans as the girls travel around and explore the area.\nWith its clever usage of lighting, contrast between confined rooms and vast\nlandscape, placing characters at the right spots for the sense of space and\ndepth of field, it makes us viewers feel like we’re actually belonging there.\nWithout having any flashy cinematographic tricks, but just simple zoom-outs and\npanoramic shots of the character surrounded by the environment, Yuru Camp\nexponentially increased the visual appeal of the scenarios.\nThe character design is rather okay for a slice-of-life anime as well. They are\nnot too overstylized, a bit on the simpler side, but consistently fitting with\nthe realistic, soothing feeling of the backgrounds. Their clothes are not\nover-the-top either, yet the show gives them a surprisingly variety of outfits\nfor each of the girls. Rin’s hairstyle and her fashion choices as a whole makes\nher a very visually dynamic character, and the hairstyles even turned into\nrunning jokes throughout the anime.\nThe show’s animation is very clean and fluid, definitely above average compared\nto what you would see from a slice-of-life anime. Despite that, there isn’t too\nmuch focus on movement, and it can look quite static at times. Some parts of the\nshow are surprisingly detailed in animation, but then it’s sadly balanced out by\nabusing static and panning shots. Rather inconsistent, but always serviceable\nenough, and not a pain to look at.\n\nAudio\nMusic in Yuru Camp is excellent. We can just stop there and let you watch the\nentire thing yourself to see how it is. But, to delve deeper into things, the\nbackground music is perfect, truly spot on for each scene. It doesn’t just let\none song run mindlessly in the background while things happen on-screen, instead\naccurately timing pauses for the comedy scenes, and saving the best parts of\neach track for the best part of each scene. To put it simply, it does a very\nbasic thing of, knowing when to stop and start, how to transit between calming\nmusic and comedic scenes, and which track to play when. It’s a very basic thing,\nbut it had a lot of effort put in.\nOutside of music, the audio effects in the show is also very well done. The way\nthey crafted all the ambient sound effects for the environments really makes the\nshow much more immersive. The wind breezing, leaves rustling, etc. It just feels\nvery relaxing for the listener, even without the visuals. The girls also have\nvery distinct personalities that I think are shown very well through their voice\nactors. Nadeshiko’s voice truly shines her character through - a cute cinnamon\nroll that’s just so, so pure. The quiet, but very empathetic trait of Rin’s is\nalso shown well in her voice acting. Of course, with that, for the rest of the\nmain cast, the energy in Chiaki’s voice and the soothingness felt inside Aoi’s\nvoice is also very much perfectly nailed.\n\nWriting\nI did point out how Yuru Camp is very much straight to the point previously. And\nwhile it’s a definitely an interesting thing to see, this is also the show’s\nweakness. The girls, and the scenarios depicted, all focus around the idea of\ncamping. Everything they talk about is also camping, everything they do in the\nshow is also just camping. Some people will dislike this, since it can feel very\nmuch boring at times throughout the show, since it seemingly doesn’t focus on\nanything else.\nBut, that isn’t to say the writing is uncreative or shallow. Within the show’s\nconsistent theme of camping, it also talks about friendship and trying out new\nthings. You have Nadeshiko, a girl who just moved into town, experiencing\ncamping itself for the first time; and you have Rin, a loner introvert,\nexperiencing camping (but with friends) for the first time. Rather simple\nthemes, but how it was executed is a high point of the show. Even though you\nhave two characters who seemingly contrast in personalities, there is never a\nsituation where one side is depicted as “wrong” or “problematic”. Rin is\nintroverted and loves camping alone, but she warms up to the experience of\ncamping with others in the show. And of course, as stated, her introvertedness\nisn’t shown as “problematic”. It stays essential to her character, and other\ngirls respect her boundaries. This same idea applies to Nadeshiko - an extremely\nextroverted girl who would seem to invade Rin’s boundaries. She understands that\nforcing Rin to change isn’t right, and lets Rin develop her own character in her\nown pace. The girls’ mutual understanding and respect towards eachother truly\nmakes the show very interesting to see.\nEverything in the show also doesn’t feel forced. In fact, it feels very\nspontaneous and natural, as though anyone could imagine themselves in those\nsituations. The girls’ conversations feel very natural, and how they interact\nwith eachother also has the same feeling to it. The “jokes” in the show aren’t\nstructured to be clear “jokes”. The show doesn’t try to tell you “hey, this is\nfunny, this is why they are laughing” and it just feels genuine, both for the\ngirls in the show and the viewers themselves. On top of this, the comedy\nthroughout the show feels very much spontaneous, not forced to be comedic, and\noverall doesn’t overstay its welcome at all.\nNotice how Yuru Camp has a consistent theme on camping, going outside and\nenjoying the environment. But it doesn’t force the girls (or in fact, any\ncharacter in the show) to always be disconnected from technology. On the other\nhand, Yuru Camp lets the girls use technology to show their friendship and how\nthey connect to eachother. They use their phones to communicate and to plan\nthings. Rin and Saitou mostly talk to eachother through phone text messages, yet\nstill deeply understand eachother. Nadeshiko and Rin, despite being hundreds of\nkilometers away from eachother physically during Rin’s solo camping trip, still\nconnect deeply to eachother, to the point Nadeshiko becomes Rin’s remote tour\nguide by talking to her by text.\n\nAfterwords\nThis has been a rather long post, and this is my first time writing something\nlike this. I feel like, for Yuru Camp enjoyers, the way I enjoyed this show\nmight be very much relatable and familiar to others of the same mind as well. I\ntruly enjoyed both seasons of the show, and the manga as well. Please support\nthe author whenever and whereever you can. Maybe once I rewatch both seasons of\nthe anime after the movie has released (yes, a movie is coming!), I will come\nback to this again and write another one of these.\n","description":"","id":"https://rylie.moe/blog/yuru-camp/","path":"/blog/yuru-camp/","title":"Yuru Camp: A chill camping experience from home"},"https://rylie.moe/projects/":{"body":"work in progress. come back later!\n","description":"","id":"https://rylie.moe/projects/","path":"/projects/","title":"projects"}},"docInfo":{"https://rylie.moe/":{"body":127,"description":0,"path":0,"title":2},"https://rylie.moe/archive/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://rylie.moe/blog/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://rylie.moe/blog/aoc-2022-day-01/":{"body":551,"description":0,"path":5,"title":6},"https://rylie.moe/blog/aoc-2022-day-02/":{"body":645,"description":0,"path":5,"title":6},"https://rylie.moe/blog/aoc-2022-day-03/":{"body":574,"description":0,"path":5,"title":6},"https://rylie.moe/blog/bad-game-design-persona-5-royal/":{"body":770,"description":0,"path":7,"title":9},"https://rylie.moe/blog/csctf-2024-notes/":{"body":265,"description":0,"path":4,"title":3},"https://rylie.moe/blog/her-tears-were-my-light/":{"body":127,"description":31,"path":3,"title":3},"https://rylie.moe/blog/kamal-tailscale-github-actions/":{"body":572,"description":17,"path":5,"title":9},"https://rylie.moe/blog/macross-delta/":{"body":421,"description":0,"path":3,"title":3},"https://rylie.moe/blog/no-code-sundays/":{"body":218,"description":0,"path":3,"title":4},"https://rylie.moe/blog/picoctf-2024-cryptography/":{"body":312,"description":0,"path":4,"title":3},"https://rylie.moe/blog/picoctf-2024-forensics/":{"body":637,"description":0,"path":4,"title":3},"https://rylie.moe/blog/picoctf-2024-web/":{"body":534,"description":0,"path":4,"title":4},"https://rylie.moe/blog/sayaka-dev-01/":{"body":607,"description":0,"path":4,"title":6},"https://rylie.moe/blog/sayaka-dev-02/":{"body":532,"description":0,"path":4,"title":7},"https://rylie.moe/blog/sekai-decompiling/":{"body":1156,"description":0,"path":3,"title":11},"https://rylie.moe/blog/understanding-maimai-rating-system/":{"body":461,"description":0,"path":5,"title":4},"https://rylie.moe/blog/wargames-bandit-0-to-7/":{"body":484,"description":0,"path":5,"title":5},"https://rylie.moe/blog/yuru-camp/":{"body":812,"description":0,"path":3,"title":6},"https://rylie.moe/projects/":{"body":5,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1}},"length":22},"lang":"English"}
