title: nhdl
---

This project was my first ever project that was written in Rust. I felt like
Rust meshed with my head very well, and I had a blast learning it. I sat down
one day and simply thought, what was the simplest thing I could write in Rust
that was somewhat useful - and nhdl was born. 

Through this project, I learnt how to process HTML inside Rust, on top of saving
files into a directory. Be warned - the code is extremely fragile and messy, as
I was barely learning Rust, going into the project! As a matter of fact, it's
actually non-functional right now, since it cannot pass nhentai's captcha! A
rewrite is coming up, with proper unit tests, benchmarks and settings.

You can find the source code for it [here](https://github.com/j1nxie/nhdl).
