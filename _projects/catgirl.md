title: catgirl
---

My personal website has gone through many iterations, with the most of its time spent using the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme. I really wanted to try something new, and I didn't manage to find another theme that really matched my taste. After stumbling upon [hikari-no-yume's webpage](https://hikari.noyu.me/), I really liked its aesthetics, and so catgirl was born.

The name "catgirl" wasn't created using much thoughts, I just thought of the most anime thing I could at the moment, and hence, "catgirl". You'll see the inclusion of an image of Suisei with her cat ears hoodie barely fits the name, since I was too lazy to edit pics of Chocola and Vanilla from Nekopara.

From working on this theme, I really appreciated how powerful Sass is as a whole, as it really helped me with making everything relatively clean. I also learnt quite a ton of HTML, as this is my first ever (surprisingly!) frontend web project.

~~As this theme is really geared towards personal usage, and I am still in the process of learning how to manage Ruby gems, a lot of the customizations will be a bit messy between the gem source code and my own website's repository. I'm still very new to this - sorry!~~

Welp, here's me in July 2024, updating this again. Sass is still neat, raw HTML/CSS/JS is still my go-to stack whenever I think of a "beginner" web development stack, but managing Ruby gems has become a bitch in the long term, especially with how *personal* this really is. This theme now lives entirely under my repository - and I don't think I would be "releasing" any new updates for it, other than direct changes to my website! Anyone interested can always take a look - make a copy and do whatever with the theme though!

The theme isn't too fancy, it boils down to pure CSS on top of HTML, sprinkled with Jekyll magic on top. The theme lives under my website [here](https://github.com/j1nxie/j1nxie.github.io), and an archive of the original theme before the repository merge can be found [here](https://github.com/j1nxie/catgirl).
