title: catgirl
---

My personal website has gone through many iterations, with the most of its time
spent using the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)
theme. I really wanted to try something new, and I didn't manage to find another
theme that really matched my taste. After stumbling upon [hikari-no-yume's
webpage](https://hikari.noyu.me/), I really liked its aesthetics, and so catgirl
was born.

The name "catgirl" wasn't created using much thoughts, I just thought of the
most anime thing I could at the moment, and hence, "catgirl". You'll see the
inclusion of an image of Suisei with her cat ears hoodie barely fits the name,
since I was too lazy to edit pics of Chocola and Vanilla from Nekopara.

From working on this theme, I really appreciated how powerful Sass is as a
whole, as it really helped me with making everything relatively clean. I also
learnt quite a ton of HTML, as this is my first ever (surprisingly!) frontend
web project.

As this theme is really geared towards personal usage, and I am still in the
process of learning how to manage Jekyll gems, a lot of the customizations will
be a bit messy between the gem source code and my own website's repository. I'm
still very new to this - sorry!

The theme isn't too fancy, it boils down to pure CSS on top of HTML, sprinkled
with Jekyll magic on top. You can find the Jekyll theme's source code

code [here](https://github.com/j1nxie/j1nxie.github.io).
