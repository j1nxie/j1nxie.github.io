What does it do? Well, seeing that a lot of people are posting images from the various imageboards like Gelbooru and Danbooru, there’s bound to be plenty of AI art or AI-assisted art. Disallowing people posting art from certain artists is still rather difficult due to the sheer amount of people just… not being able to read, ignorance, mistakes, so on and so forth. It’s a lot of work for moderators to actually scan through and spot these images, and it looks like a very automatable thing because we <em>have</em> a list of disallowed artists, thus, Jane Doe was born! It uses <code>dhash</code><sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-1-1><a href=#fn-1>1</a></sup> to compare posted images with a database of known images, scraped off of imageboards.<p>I’ll talk more about Jane Doe in another blog post in the near future (maybe) (if I ever get around to writing one) (I swear), what we’re going to look at today is how I built the infrastructure to deploy it to my servers securely.<h1 id=introducing-kamal><a aria-label="Anchor link for: introducing-kamal" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#introducing-kamal><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> Introducing Kamal</h1><p><a class=external href=https://kamal-deploy.org/>Kamal</a> is a neat little tool that wraps around Docker and SSH to quickly deploy web apps to various servers from your own machine. By default, running <code>kamal deploy</code> in a Kamal-initialized repository will trigger a build using the Dockerfile within the repository, then it will proceed to deploy said build to servers that you’ve defined within the config file.<p>Kamal also comes with the ability to define “accessories”. These are long-running services that are required by your app, such as databases, similar to things you would define in your Docker Compose file. Running <code>kamal accessory boot</code> will spin up new accessory services on the defined hosts.<h1 id=introducing-tailscale><a aria-label="Anchor link for: introducing-tailscale" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#introducing-tailscale><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> Introducing Tailscale</h1><p><a class=external href=https://tailscale.com/>Tailscale</a> is a VPN service that allows connecting your devices securely under networks called “tailnets”. This is what I will use to connect to my machines without the need to expose their IPs and port 22 to the public Internet.<h1 id=introducing-github-actions><a aria-label="Anchor link for: introducing-github-actions" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#introducing-github-actions><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> Introducing GitHub Actions</h1><p>…really now, you wouldn’t need this to be introduced, would you?<p>Fiiiiiiiine, I’ll tell you about it anyways. <a class=external href=https://github.com/features/actions>GitHub Actions</a> is GitHub’s own CI/CD<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-2-1><a href=#fn-2>2</a></sup> platform, for automating software development workflows. You can define triggers to automatically run test suites, Docker builds, so on. We’ll use this to automatically build our Discord bot and deploy a build through Kamal.<p>Anyways, with our major players introduced out of the way, let’s get started with how this works.<h1 id=initializing-and-configuring-kamal><a aria-label="Anchor link for: initializing-and-configuring-kamal" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#initializing-and-configuring-kamal><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> Initializing and configuring Kamal</h1><p>We’ll start with initializing Kamal within the repository. You’ll need <code>config/kamal.yml</code>, which can be quickly created using <code>kamal init</code>.

</span></code></pre><p>Woah, that’s one hella long workflow file. My build job is nothing too complicated, just the usual <code>docker/build-push-action</code> setup to get an image up into GHCR. The main interesting part is in the <code>deploy</code> job, let’s see how it works.<p>Well, I sort of lied, the first half of installing Ruby into the environment, setting up Kamal, setting up Tailscale using the <a class=external href=https://tailscale.com/kb/1276/tailscale-github-action>official guide</a>, nothing too interesting.<p>I use <a class=external href=https://github.com/webfactory/ssh-agent><code>webfactory/ssh-agent</code></a> to insert a SSH private key into the GitHub Action worker node, as my server has password authentication disabled.<blockquote><p>This setup doesn’t work right out of the box, you’ll need to do a bit of bootstrapping! Create a new SSH keypair on your server and add it to the <code>root</code> user’s authorized keys:<pre class="language-sh z-code" data-lang=sh><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class="z-source z-shell z-bash"><span class="z-meta z-function-call z-shell"><span class="z-variable z-function z-shell">sudo</span></span><span class="z-meta z-function-call z-arguments z-shell"> cat <span class="z-meta z-group z-expansion z-tilde"><span class="z-variable z-language z-tilde z-shell">~</span></span>/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub <span class="z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-redirection z-shell">></span> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys</span>
</span></code></pre><p>This will make sure that Kamal is able to SSH into the server and deploy the Discord bot!<p>Why <code>root</code>? Uh… I run <a class=external href=https://fishshell.com/>fish</a> on my servers and they aren’t compatible with the commands that Kamal runs to deploy the services… Please create a user for deployment on your server and add the public key to that user’s <code>authorized_keys</code> file instead. Do as I say, not as I do.</blockquote><p>Then, at the final step, we’ll pull in all the environment variables to load into Kamal as secrets, and run Kamal with the <code>--skip-push</code> argument, as we’ve already built the image during the previous step and cached it.<p>The <code>VERSION</code> environment is very important also, as the workflow will push the image on the <code>main</code> tag, whereas Kamal by default pushes and expects a version tag as the Git commit hash!<blockquote><p>Of course, remember to actually add in the secrets to your GitHub repository! I used the <code>gh</code> CLI utility to add them to my repository, through the command:<pre class="language-sh z-code" data-lang=sh><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class="z-source z-shell z-bash"><span class="z-meta z-function-call z-shell"><span class="z-variable z-function z-shell">gh</span></span><span class="z-meta z-function-call z-arguments z-shell"> secret set SECRET_NAME</span>
</span></code></pre></blockquote><p>With this setup, you’ll need to add a <code>service</code> label to the resulting Docker image, as Kamal expects this label to know which container to spin down during deployment of new versions. This label should be the same as the <code>service</code> key within Kamal’s configuration file.<pre class="language-diff z-code" data-lang=diff><code class=language-diff data-lang=diff><span class="z-source z-diff">FROM beerpsi/cargo-chef-musl-mimalloc:latest AS chef
