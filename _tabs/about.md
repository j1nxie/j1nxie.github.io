Heyo! I'm Lumine, known on other platforms as Rylie, or j1nxie. Feel free to refer to me as any of those nicknames!
This little blog here is where i write thoughts on various things, be it my personal life, anime, manga, or games that I've
been playing. Some posts will be written in my native language - Vietnamese, as i felt like they are oriented towards
said audience.

## Who am I?

I'm a casual weeb who enjoys playing video games and coding every so often. I mainly enjoy rhythm games, first-person shooters
and a little bit of everything else.

I also listen to a lot of music, including, but not limited to: J-pop, J-rock, K-pop, K-hiphop, rhythm games music and, a
personal favorite - Touhou doujin arrangements! I have always been fascinated by Touhou itself as a franchise and culture, and
Touhou music will forever stay very special to me, both as a music listener and a rhythm gamer.

I am also an osu! community member, even though inactive, I'm still trying to help out with the osu! tournament scene by doing
referee work! Hit me up if you ever need a referee in UTC+7 timezone.

## What do I do?

Right now, I mainly play rhythm games as my #1 hobby, with my main games currently being:

- [maimai DX](https://maimai.sega.com/)
- [Arcaea](https://arcaea.lowiro.com/)
- [Muse Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/774171/Muse_Dash/)
- Taiko no Tatsujin

Outside of rhythm games, I also play [CS:GO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/) as my main
first-person shooter. I'm also an inactive Arknights player (this means I literally login once in a blue moon, then grind the game
straight for a month, then repeat.)

I enjoy coding from time to time as well, and all my projects can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/j1nxie/)! My favorite
programming language is Rust, with C++ being a bit behind it. My favorite fields are game system emulation, game development
and Discord bot programming.
