    <h1>about</h1>
</div>

Hi! I go by Rylie on most platforms, \_lumi9 on a few others, and I'm also known
under many more aliases. I program random things in my free time, and I also
code professionally for a living.

I mainly write Discord bots, backend stuff, scrapers and random things I'm
interested in, with a little bit of infrastructure going along with it.

My hobbies are anime, manga, playing games and programming. I also want to
dabble in digital art too. I mainly play a ton of rhythm games, JRPGs and
shooters. Currently, I mainly spend my time playing maimai DX and BMS.
