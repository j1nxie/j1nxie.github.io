# projects
___

I have plenty of personal projects, most of which are built for learning
experiences, mainly tinkering with new tools and frameworks. Hopefully, I can
share what I've learnt through these projects!

- [nhdl](nhdl) - command-line interface nhentai downloader
- [catgirl](catgirl) - this very Jekyll theme
