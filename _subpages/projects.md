I have plenty of personal projects, most of which are built for learning experiences, mainly tinkering with new tools and frameworks. I'm also cooking a few things in secret, but that's the future to come. Hopefully, I can share what I've learnt through these projects!

-   [nhdl](projects/nhdl) - command-line interface nhentai downloader (11/2021)
-   [catgirl](projects/catgirl) - this very Jekyll theme (01/2023 - 07/2024)
-   [hoshizora](projects/hoshizora) - an ecosystem of osu!-related binaries and libraries (02/2023)
