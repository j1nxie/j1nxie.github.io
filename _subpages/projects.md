# projects
___

I have plenty of personal projects, most of which are built for learning
experiences, mainly tinkering with new tools and frameworks. Hopefully, I can
share what I've learnt through these projects! The date attached to each project
is the date I started development on said project.

- [nhdl](projects/nhdl) - command-line interface nhentai downloader (11/2021)
- [catgirl](projects/catgirl) - this very Jekyll theme (01/2023)
- [hoshizora](projects/hoshizora) - an ecosystem of osu!-related binaries and
libraries (02/2023)
