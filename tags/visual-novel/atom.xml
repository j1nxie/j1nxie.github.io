&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a love story between time and space&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Steam description was right.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“her tears were my light” is a short visual novel, made for the NaNoRenO 2016
game jam. And when I said short, it was short. All the content is explorable in
about half an hour to an hour of gameplay. Despite its length, it manages to
hold up pretty well, with plenty of cute illustrations and a really nice
soundtrack.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game follows Time, Space and Nil - the three core ideas of the entire
universe, in their love story. It’s rather surreal in some ways, but at the same
time, it gives these very grand and cosmic concepts and their relationship a
very human and emotional touch. Girls kissed. What else more could you ask for?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being Time, a key gameplay mechanic is the ability to rewind time and change the
past. This ability is executed really well, being very intuitive and doesn’t
make it feel complex for the reader. The story is intertwined heavily into this
mechanic as well, so a good execution really made everything feel fluid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, it’s a really cute game, and it doesn’t take up any time to finish. I
think it’s worth the hour spent reading. It’s available for rather cheap too -
find the game on &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nomnomnami.itch.io&#x2F;her-tears-were-my-light&quot;&gt;itch.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
