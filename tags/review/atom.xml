&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a love story between time and space&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Steam description was right.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“her tears were my light” is a short visual novel, made for the NaNoRenO 2016
game jam. And when I said short, it was short. All the content is explorable in
about half an hour to an hour of gameplay. Despite its length, it manages to
hold up pretty well, with plenty of cute illustrations and a really nice
soundtrack.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game follows Time, Space and Nil - the three core ideas of the entire
universe, in their love story. It’s rather surreal in some ways, but at the same
time, it gives these very grand and cosmic concepts and their relationship a
very human and emotional touch. Girls kissed. What else more could you ask for?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being Time, a key gameplay mechanic is the ability to rewind time and change the
past. This ability is executed really well, being very intuitive and doesn’t
make it feel complex for the reader. The story is intertwined heavily into this
mechanic as well, so a good execution really made everything feel fluid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, it’s a really cute game, and it doesn’t take up any time to finish. I
think it’s worth the hour spent reading. It’s available for rather cheap too -
find the game on &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nomnomnami.itch.io&#x2F;her-tears-were-my-light&quot;&gt;itch.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;image&#x2F;macross-delta&#x2F;poster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Macross Delta poster&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like idol shows. Unironically. I’m as much as a music enjoyer as I am an anime
enjoyer, so idol shows &lt;em&gt;really&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; strike this spot for me. During my venture on
osu! and the likes, seeing &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anilist.co&#x2F;anime&#x2F;20680&quot;&gt;Macross Delta&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;’s
music has very much piqued my interest in the series, just by how many bangers
there are, but I put off watching it for suuuuuuuch a long time. Fast forward a
few years, I pulled it to my media server’s hard drive, and seeing that we
needed to free up some space, I decided to go and watch it to see how the show
truly is outside of the songs. And I didn’t expect myself to be pulled in So.
Damn. Hard.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR, and if you wanted to avoid spoilers&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: 7.5&#x2F;10, watch it if you have a
soft spot for idol-esque shows like me, you wanna listen to absolute bangers
being inserted within a show, or you’re interested in the Macross franchise as
a whole.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential wasted on a few characters, but overall well developed. Art was
amazing for a 2016 production, maybe even better than currently airing shows.
Music is absolutely amazing, I cannot recommend their songs enough.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoilers warning! You have been warned.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the characters! I like Freyja. She is probably the most likable
idol-anime-main-character to date for me, and I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; usually one to really
just go for the main girl in an idol anime. Her character development within the
show is amazing, especially with the situations that she’s being put in, being a
Windermerean, choosing to side with the Earthlings and Walküre during a war
against Windermere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaname is probably one of my favorite characters to see as well. She’s a very
strong person, being motivated instead of being depressed from Mikumo’s
appearance replacing her role as the center of Walküre. Hers and Messer’s joint
arc really developed their characters well in my opinion, but at the same time I
wished Messer’s character and relationships were explored more within the show.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirage was &lt;em&gt;the&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; woman I rooted for within the Hayate - Freyja - Mirage love
triangle, but as track records showed, every woman I root for lost their romance
arcs &amp;lt;&#x2F;3 It’s cute to see Freyja and Hayate’s relationship develop, but at the
same time it felt like Mirage barely touched the surface of her feelings towards
Hayate. &lt;sub&gt;I’m so heartbroken my tall redhead elf woman lost…&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the characters felt like… recurring background characters that you
see here and there, funnily enough. It doesn’t feel like they play a large
enough role during the story and you barely remember the names and faces of
them. It feels like a lot of wasted potential, especially during Messer’s (and
later on Hayate’s) duels against Keith, where they often made it just 1-on-1
fights and very heavily focused on them. Even the two Walküre members, Makina
and Reina, felt like they were just there to be the harmony for Freyja and
Mikumo during songs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of story, I’m unsure how much they have &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anilist.co&#x2F;anime&#x2F;118126&quot;&gt;Zettai
Live!!!!!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in mind while writing the original
script for the TV show, but how it ended felt really… incomplete. The &lt;em&gt;literal
conflict&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that was happening within the show didn’t get resolved towards the
end, and it gives you this feeling of being left hanging.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music is definitely where Macross Delta shines the most. The insert songs
are bangers by themselves, and how they incorporated them into the show is
insane too. You often see idol-esque shows just having the audio recorded and
played during the episodes, but certain situations really made it feel like the
Walküre members are truly live on stage. Their vocals are re-recorded to make
you really hear the situation they’re in, like how they mixed in Makina’s weak
singing voice trying to harmonize with her group after taking a sniper shot to
protect Freyja, or their voices straining as they are trying to move around
while being attacked by the Aerial Knights.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, Macross Delta’s art stands very well against a lot of anime, in my
opinion. They don’t often have weird frames where the characters are insanely
lowres, the fights are choreographed really nicely, the characters are very well
done too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, it was a very enjoyable experience. I was pretty hooked in for the 26
episodes and &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; am one to have a short attention span. So there’s that, now
GO WATCH IT!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <title>Yuru Camp: A chill camping experience from home</title>

        <id>https://rylie.moe/blog/yuru-camp/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest, I’m a gigantic sucker for slice-of-life anime. My &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myanimelist.net&#x2F;animelist&#x2F;RylieXD?status=2&quot;&gt;anime
list&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is literally
chock-full of slice-of-life, with only a few selective shounens here and there.
Most of the slice-of-life stuff are, as expected, mundane, basic and niche. But,
one slice-of-life anime that truly struck different from everything else, is
&lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myanimelist.net&#x2F;anime&#x2F;34798&#x2F;Yuru_Camp%E2%96%B3&quot;&gt;Yuru Camp&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;premise&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#premise&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: premise&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Premise&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is Yuru Camp? It’s an anime about a group of girls who form a camping
club at their school, and it’s just about that. Camping, as it is, not just as a
side activity or as something to build the characters upon. The anime just
focuses around camping as an experience, no tension, no drama, that’s it. It’s a
very straightforward anime with what it wants to cover and evolve.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this is what makes Yuru Camp really good. It doesn’t have
something that people would just outright, “hate”, because from its premise,
Yuru Camp just feels like a very comfortable show that anyone can get into.
People can dislike it, but it wasn’t a type of “controversial” anime that has
something that would really spark hatred, so those people who did were probably
not vocal about it. But then, trying to sell Yuru Camp to others is also just as
hard, because it seems like there is no appeal for a show that’s just harmless,
fun and chill compared to something else with (comparatively) more memorable
emotional moments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, you cannot just recommend Yuru Camp to a skeptical person as it is.
You have to show them how it actually feels to sit down and watch an episode of
it. The quiet environment that it gives out is just soothing, just like having
those ASMR audios in the background, but it’s definitely more visual. Pure
calmness of mind, no more, no less.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;visuals&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#visuals&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: visuals&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Visuals&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, to say that the premise carried everything in the series is
definitely a mistake. Each episode is carefully crafted and executed properly,
and there isn’t anything that would make you feel, “oh wow, this is &lt;em&gt;sooooo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; out
of place.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visuals are an instant praise, honestly. The backgrounds are super detailed,
and they’re just amazing wallpaper material. I cannot stop taking screenshots of
those landscape camera pans as the girls travel around and explore the area.
With its clever usage of lighting, contrast between confined rooms and vast
landscape, placing characters at the right spots for the sense of space and
depth of field, it makes us viewers feel like we’re actually belonging there.
Without having any flashy cinematographic tricks, but just simple zoom-outs and
panoramic shots of the character surrounded by the environment, Yuru Camp
exponentially increased the visual appeal of the scenarios.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The character design is rather okay for a slice-of-life anime as well. They are
not too overstylized, a bit on the simpler side, but consistently fitting with
the realistic, soothing feeling of the backgrounds. Their clothes are not
over-the-top either, yet the show gives them a surprisingly variety of outfits
for each of the girls. Rin’s hairstyle and her fashion choices as a whole makes
her a very visually dynamic character, and the hairstyles even turned into
running jokes throughout the anime.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show’s animation is very clean and fluid, definitely above average compared
to what you would see from a slice-of-life anime. Despite that, there isn’t too
much focus on movement, and it can look quite static at times. Some parts of the
show are surprisingly detailed in animation, but then it’s sadly balanced out by
abusing static and panning shots. Rather inconsistent, but always serviceable
enough, and not a pain to look at.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;audio&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#audio&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: audio&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Audio&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music in Yuru Camp is excellent. We can just stop there and let you watch the
entire thing yourself to see how it is. But, to delve deeper into things, the
background music is perfect, truly spot on for each scene. It doesn’t just let
one song run mindlessly in the background while things happen on-screen, instead
accurately timing pauses for the comedy scenes, and saving the best parts of
each track for the best part of each scene. To put it simply, it does a very
basic thing of, knowing when to stop and start, how to transit between calming
music and comedic scenes, and which track to play when. It’s a very basic thing,
but it had a lot of effort put in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of music, the audio effects in the show is also very well done. The way
they crafted all the ambient sound effects for the environments really makes the
show much more immersive. The wind breezing, leaves rustling, etc. It just feels
very relaxing for the listener, even without the visuals. The girls also have
very distinct personalities that I think are shown very well through their voice
actors. Nadeshiko’s voice truly shines her character through - a cute cinnamon
roll that’s just so, so pure. The quiet, but very empathetic trait of Rin’s is
also shown well in her voice acting. Of course, with that, for the rest of the
main cast, the energy in Chiaki’s voice and the soothingness felt inside Aoi’s
voice is also very much perfectly nailed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#writing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: writing&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Writing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did point out how Yuru Camp is very much straight to the point previously. And
while it’s a definitely an interesting thing to see, this is also the show’s
weakness. The girls, and the scenarios depicted, all focus around the idea of
camping. Everything they talk about is also camping, everything they do in the
show is also just camping. Some people will dislike this, since it can feel very
much boring at times throughout the show, since it seemingly doesn’t focus on
anything else.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, that isn’t to say the writing is uncreative or shallow. Within the show’s
consistent theme of camping, it also talks about friendship and trying out new
things. You have Nadeshiko, a girl who just moved into town, experiencing
camping itself for the first time; and you have Rin, a loner introvert,
experiencing camping &lt;strong&gt;(but with friends)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; for the first time. Rather simple
themes, but how it was executed is a high point of the show. Even though you
have two characters who seemingly contrast in personalities, there is never a
situation where one side is depicted as “wrong” or “problematic”. Rin is
introverted and loves camping alone, but she warms up to the experience of
camping with others in the show. And of course, as stated, her introvertedness
isn’t shown as “problematic”. It stays essential to her character, and other
girls respect her boundaries. This same idea applies to Nadeshiko - an extremely
extroverted girl who would seem to invade Rin’s boundaries. She understands that
forcing Rin to change isn’t right, and lets Rin develop her own character in her
own pace. The girls’ mutual understanding and respect towards eachother truly
makes the show very interesting to see.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything in the show also doesn’t feel forced. In fact, it feels very
spontaneous and natural, as though anyone could imagine themselves in those
situations. The girls’ conversations feel very natural, and how they interact
with eachother also has the same feeling to it. The “jokes” in the show aren’t
structured to be clear “jokes”. The show doesn’t try to tell you “hey, this is
funny, this is why they are laughing” and it just feels genuine, both for the
girls in the show and the viewers themselves. On top of this, the comedy
throughout the show feels very much spontaneous, not forced to be comedic, and
overall doesn’t overstay its welcome at all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how Yuru Camp has a consistent theme on camping, going outside and
enjoying the environment. But it doesn’t force the girls (or in fact, any
character in the show) to always be disconnected from technology. On the other
hand, Yuru Camp lets the girls use technology to show their friendship and how
they connect to eachother. They use their phones to communicate and to plan
things. Rin and Saitou mostly talk to eachother through phone text messages, yet
still deeply understand eachother. Nadeshiko and Rin, despite being hundreds of
kilometers away from eachother physically during Rin’s solo camping trip, still
connect deeply to eachother, to the point Nadeshiko becomes Rin’s remote tour
guide by talking to her by text.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;afterwords&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#afterwords&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: afterwords&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Afterwords&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a rather long post, and this is my first time writing something
like this. I feel like, for Yuru Camp enjoyers, the way I enjoyed this show
might be very much relatable and familiar to others of the same mind as well. I
truly enjoyed both seasons of the show, and the manga as well. Please support
the author whenever and whereever you can. Maybe once I rewatch both seasons of
the anime after the movie has released (yes, a movie is coming!), I will come
back to this again and write another one of these.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
