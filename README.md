# rylie.moe

the source code for my own website, [rylie.moe](https://rylie.moe)!

originally a Jekyll gem, [catgirl](https://github.com/j1nxie/catgirl), now merged straight into the website for ease of management.

this started off as a website using the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme, but after stumbling upon [hikari](https://hikari.noyu.me)'s website, i fell in love with the aesthetics and decided to rewrite my own, under inspiration from it!
